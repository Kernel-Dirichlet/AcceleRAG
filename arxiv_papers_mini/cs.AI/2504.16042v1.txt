ABSTRACT
In this article, we address the inconsistency of a system of m ax-min fuzzy relational equations by
minimally modifying the matrix governing the system in orde r to achieve consistency. Our method
yields consistent systems that approximate the original in consistent system in the following sense:
the right-hand side vector of each consistent system is that of the inconsistent system, and the co-
efﬁcients of the matrix governing each consistent system ar e obtained by modifying, exactly and
minimally, the entries of the original matrix that must be co rrected to achieve consistency, while
leaving all other entries unchanged.
To obtain a consistent system that closely approximates the considered inconsistent system, we
study the distance (in terms of a norm among L1,L2orL∞) between the matrix of the inconsistent
system and the set formed by the matrices of consistent syste ms that use the same right-hand side
vector as the inconsistent system. We show that our method al lows us to directly compute matrices
of consistent systems that use the same right-hand side vect or as the inconsistent system whose
distance in terms of L∞norm to the matrix of the inconsistent system is minimal (the computational
costs are higher when using L1norm orL2norm). We also give an explicit analytical formula for
computing this minimal L∞distance. Finally, we translate our results for systems of m in-max fuzzy
relational equations and present some potential applicati ons.
Keywords Fuzzy set theory, Systems of fuzzy relational equations
1 Introduction
Systems of fuzzy relational equations are the basis of many f uzzy modeling approaches [15, 16, 25], including Zadeh’s
possibility theory for approximate reasoning [35], and hav e been applied in some practical areas of Artiﬁcial Intelli-
gence (AI), such as medical diagnosis [1, 7, 30]. The pioneer ing work of Sanchez [29, 30] provided necessary and
sufﬁcient conditions for a system of max-min fuzzy relation al equations to be consistent, i.e., when the system has
solutions. Sanchez showed that, when a max-min system is con sistent, the structure of its solutions set is given by a
solution which is the greatest and a ﬁnite number of minimal s olutions. His work has been extended to systems based
onmax−Tcompositions where Tis a continuous t-norm [11, 13, 14, 19, 21, 23, 24, 31], system s based on max−∗
compositions, where ∗is an increasing and continuous function [22], and systems b ased onmin−ITcompositions,
whereITis the residual implicator associated with a continuous t-n ormT, see [6, 27].
However, addressing the inconsistency of systems of fuzzy r elational equations remains an open problem today
[11, 17, 26]. For max-min systems, researchers have worked o n ﬁnding approximate solutions [9, 10, 20, 18], and on
the computation of approximate inverses of fuzzy matrices [ 33, 34]. An emerging development is based on Pedrycz’s
approach [26]: Perdycz proposed to slightly modify the righ t-hand side vector of an inconsistent max-min system in
order to obtain a consistent system. Then, the solutions of t he obtained consistent system are considered as approxi-
mate solutions of the inconsistent system. Some authors pro posed algorithms [9, 10, 20] based on Pedrycz’s approach
for obtaining a consistent system close to a given inconsist ent system. More recently, the author of [4, 5] studied the
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
inconsistency of systems of max−Tfuzzy relational equations, where Tis a continuous t-norm among minimum,
product, or Lukasiewicz’s t-norm. For each of the three max−Tsystems, the author of [4, 5] provided an explicit
analytical formula to compute the Chebyshev distance (deﬁn ed by L-inﬁnity norm) between the right-hand side vector
of an inconsistent system and the set of right-hand side vect ors of consistent systems deﬁned with the same composi-
tion and the same matrix as the inconsistent system. Based on these results, the author of [4, 5] studied the Chebyshev
approximations of the right-hand side vector of a given inco nsistent system of max−Tfuzzy relational equations
[10, 20], where each of these approximations is the right-ha nd side vector of a consistent system deﬁned with the same
matrix as the inconsistent system and such that its distance to the right-hand side vector of the inconsistent system is
equal to the computed Chebyshev distance. For each of the thr eemax−Tsystems, the author of [4, 5] showed that
the greatest Chebyshev approximation of the right-hand sid e vector of an inconsistent max−Tsystem can be com-
puted by an explicit analytical formula. Furthermore, for m ax-min systems, the author of [5] provided the complete
description of the structure of the set of Chebyshev approxi mations. The author of [4, 5] also studied the approximate
solutions of inconsistent max−Tsystems, deﬁned as the solutions of the consistent systems w hose matrix is that of
the inconsistent system and whose right-hand side vector is a Chebyshev approximation of the right-hand side vector
of the inconsistent system. For each of the three max−Tsystems, the author of [4, 5] showed that the greatest approx -
imate solution of a given inconsistent system can be compute d by an explicit analytical formula. For systems based on
the max-min composition, the author of [5] gave a complete de scription of the structure of the approximate solutions
set of the inconsistent system. Furthermore, for max-min sy stems, the author of [18] proposed a linear optimization
method for computing L∞andL1approximate solutions.
The works [5, 9, 10, 20] build on Pedrycz’s approach, focus on minimally modifying the right-hand side vector of
an inconsistent systems, while keeping the matrix unmodiﬁe d. In this article, we follow a different approach: we
focus on minimally modifying the matrix of an inconsistent m ax-min system in order to obtain a consistent system,
while keeping the right-hand side vector unchanged . This problem was studied by [8, 20] where the authors propos ed
algorithms for estimating the Chebyshev distance between t he matrix of an inconsistent system and the closest matrix
of a consistent system, where both systems have the same ﬁxed right-hand side vector.
In this article, we consider an inconsistent system of max-m in fuzzy relational equations of the form A/squaremax
minx=b,
where the matrix Ais of size (n,m), the right-hand side vector bhasncomponents, xis an unknown vector of m
components and the matrix product /squaremax
minuses the t-norm min as the product and the function max as the addition.
We begin by deﬁning, in (17), the set T, which is formed by the matrices governing the consistent ma x-min systems
that use the same right-hand side vector: the right-hand sid e vectorbof the inconsistent system. Then, we introduce,
in (18), the distance denoted by ˚∆pbetween the matrix Aof the inconsistent system and the set T, which is measured
with respect to a given norm among L1,L2, orL∞.
To introduce our method for constructing matrices of the set T, we begin with a preliminary study. We deﬁne an
auxiliary matrix A(i,j), which minimally modify the matrix Aof the inconsistent system A/squaremax
minx=b, in order to
satisfy the following constraint: δA(i,j)(i,j) = 0 , see (8) and Lemma 3, where the scalar δA(i,j)(i,j)is involved in the
formula of [5] of the Chebyshev distance ∆ = max
1≤k≤nδA(i,j)
k whereδA(i,j)
k= min
1≤j≤mδA(i,j)(k,j), see (11), associated
with the right-hand side vector bof the max-min system A(i,j)/squaremax
minx=b. We then deﬁne the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)in (27),
whose construction is an iterative composition (27) of auxi liary matrices A(i,j). In Proposition 5, we give a simpler
construction of these matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj).
When the pair of vectors (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)used to construct the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)of (27) are set from the subset of indices corre-
sponding to the inconsistent equations of the system A/squaremax
minx=bwith respect to the Chebyshev distance ∆(each
equation whose index i∈ {1,2,...,n}is such that δA
i>0, see (11)) and a subset of column indices of the matrix
A, we prove in Theorem 1 that the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)belong to the set T. The matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)of consistent systems
constructed in Theorem 1 have important properties. In Theo rem 2, we show that the modiﬁcations applied to the
original matrix Aof the inconsistent system to obtain the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)of the consistent systems are minimal. This
result allows us to compute the distance ˚∆p, see (18), in a simpler way, see Corollary 3. Furthermore, wh en using the
L∞norm, i.e., p=∞, we show that the distance ˚∆∞, see (18), can be computed using an explicit analytical form ula,
see Corollary 4, and we provide a method to construct a non-em pty and ﬁnite subset of matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)whose distance
to the matrix Aof the inconsistent system is equal to the scalar ˚∆∞, see (37). Finally, we translate the tools and results
obtained for max-min systems to the corresponding tools and results for min-max systems, see Subsection 5.2.
The article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we give th e necessary background for studying inconsistent max-min
systems. In Section 3, we present our problem formally and we introduce the construction of the auxiliary matrices,
and the iterative construction (27) based on them. In Sectio n 4, we show our main results: Theorem 1, Theorem 2,

Corollary 3 and Corollary 4. In Section 5, we translate our re sults with max-min systems to min-max systems. Finally,
we conclude with some perspectives.
2 Background
In this section, we give the necessary background for studyi ng max-min systems. We begin by giving some notations.
We then remind the solving of max-min systems and some of the r esults of [5] for handling the inconsistency of
max-min systems.
2.1 Notations and matrix products
We use the following notations:
Notation 1. [0,1]n×mdenotes the set of matrices of size (n,m)i.e.,nrows and mcolumns, whose components are
in[0,1]. In particular:
•[0,1]n×1denotes the set of column vectors of ncomponents,
•[0,1]1×mdenotes the set of row matrices of mcomponents.
In the set [0,1]n×m, we use the order relation ≤deﬁned by:
A≤Biff we have aij≤bij for all1≤i≤n,1≤j≤m,
whereA= [aij]1≤i≤n,1≤j≤mandB= [bij]1≤i≤n,1≤j≤m.
The two matrix products /squaremax
min, and/squaremin
→Gused in this article are deﬁned by modifying the usual matrix product:
• the matrix product /squaremax
minis obtained by taking the t-norm min as the product and the function max as the
addition.
• the matrix product /squaremin
→Gis obtained by taking the Gödel implication →G, which is deﬁned by:
x→Gy=/braceleftbigg1ifx≤y
yotherwise.in[0,1] (1)
as the product and the function min as the addition.
2.2 Systems of max-min fuzzy relational equations
LetA= [aij]∈[0,1]n×mbe a matrix of size (n,m)andb= [bi]∈[0,1]n×1be a vector of ncomponents. The
system of max-min fuzzy relational equations associated wi th(A,b)is denoted by:
(S) :A/squaremax
minx=b, (2)
wherex= [xj]1≤j≤m∈[0,1]m×1is an unknown vector of mcomponents. By deﬁnition of the matrix product /squaremax
min,
the system (S)is equivalent to the following set of nmax-min equations:
max
1≤j≤mmin(aij,xj) =bi,∀i∈ {1,2,...,n}.
To check if the system (S), see (2), is consistent, we compute the following vector:
e=At/squaremin
→Gb, (3)
whereAtis the transpose of Aand we use the matrix product /squaremin
→G(Notation 1). The components of the vector
e= [ej]1≤j≤mare given by:
ej= min
1≤i≤n(aij→Gbi),∀j∈ {1,2,...,m}.
The vector eis the potential greatest solution of the system (S).
Thanks to Sanchez’s seminal work [29] on the solving of syste ms max-min fuzzy relational equations, we have the
following equivalence:
The system (S)is consistent ⇐⇒A/squaremax
mine=b. (4)
3

The set of solutions of the system (S)is denoted by:
S=S(A,b) ={v∈[0,1]m×1|A/squaremax
minv=b}. (5)
The structure of the solution set was described by Sanchez in [29] for systems of max-min fuzzy relational equations.
He proved that if Sis non-empty i.e., the system (S)is consistent, the structure of Sis given by the vector e=
At/squaremin
→Gb, see (3), which is the greatest solution of the system (S)and a ﬁnite number of minimal solutions.
Example 1. Let a max-min system A/squaremax
minx=bbe deﬁned by A=/bracketleftBigg0.79 0.29 0.28
0.76 0.79 0.18
0.53 0.21 0.11/bracketrightBigg
andb=/bracketleftBigg0.35
0.6
0.35/bracketrightBigg
.
We compute the potential greatest solution of the system:
e=At/squaremin
→Gb=/bracketleftBiggmin(0.79→G0.35,0.76→G0.6,0.53→G0.35)
min(0.29→G0.35,0.79→G0.6,0.21→G0.35)
min(0.28→G0.35,0.18→G0.6,0.11→G0.35)/bracketrightBigg
=/bracketleftBigg0.35
0.6
1/bracketrightBigg
.
The equation system A/squaremax
minx=bis consistent because:
A/squaremax
mine=/bracketleftBiggmax(min(0 .79,0.35),min(0.29,0.6),min(0.28,1))
max(min(0 .76,0.35),min(0.79,0.6),min(0.18,1))
max(min(0 .53,0.35),min(0.21,0.6),min(0.11,1))/bracketrightBigg
=/bracketleftBigg0.35
0.6
0.35/bracketrightBigg
=b.
So the vector eis the greatest solution of the system.
2.3 Handling inconsistent systems of max-min fuzzy relatio nal equations
Recently, the author of [5] studied how to handle inconsiste nt systems of max-min fuzzy relational equations. The
tools introduced by [5] follow the strategy proposed by Pedr ycz in [26], which is as follows: given an inconsistent
system, we perturb, as slighly as possible, the components o f the right-hand side vector of the inconsistent system in
order to obtain a consistent system.
To remind the tools of the author [5] we reuse some of his notat ions:
Notation 2. Forx,y,z,u,δ ∈[0,1], we use the following notations:
•x+= max(x,0),
•z(δ) = min( z+δ,1),
•z(δ) = max( z−δ,0) = (z−δ)+.
We rely on the following function, which was introduced in [5 ]:
σG(x,y,z) = min((x−z)+
2,(y−z)+)wherex,y,z∈[0,1]. (6)
LetT= [tij]1≤i≤n,1≤j≤m∈[0,1]n×mbe a matrix. We rely on the following function deﬁned for all i∈
{1,2,···,n}, which appears in [5] and uses the matrix Tand the right-hand side vector b= [bi]∈[0,1]n×1of
the system T/squaremax
minx=b:
[0,1]n×m→[0,1] :T/mapsto→δT
i= min
1≤j≤mδT(i,j) (7)
where:
δT(i,j) = max[( bi−tij)+,max
1≤k≤nσG(bi,tkj,bk)] (see (6) for the deﬁnition of σG) (8)
Since the operations involved (minimum, maximum, and takin g the positive part) are continuous on the compact set
[0,1]n×m, we get the following result:
Lemma 1. For alli∈ {1,2,···,n}, the function [0,1]n×m→[0,1] :T/mapsto→δT
iis continuous.
Given the matrix Aof an inconsistent max-min system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b, see (2), the author of [5] deﬁnes:
Deﬁnition 1. The set formed by the right-hand side vectors of the consiste nt systems deﬁned with the same matrix A
of the system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=bis:
C={c∈[0,1]n×1|the system A/squaremax
minx=cis consistent }. (9)

Deﬁnition 2. The Chebyshev distance (using L-inﬁnity norm) associated w ith the inconsistent max-min system (S) :
A/squaremax
minx=b(see (2)) is:
∆ = min
c∈C/ba∇dblb−c/ba∇dbl∞where/ba∇dblb−c/ba∇dbl= max
1≤i≤n|bi−ci|. (10)
The author of [5] introduced an analytical formula for compu ting the Chebyshev distance ∆(Deﬁnition 2) associated
to the max-min system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b, which relies on δA
i, see (7):
∆ = ∆(A,b) = max
1≤i≤nδA
i (11)
The following results were proven in [5]:
∆ = 0⇐⇒ the system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=bis consistent. (12)
We deﬁne a subset of C, see (9):
Deﬁnition 3. The set of Chebyshev approximations of the right-hand side v ectorbof the system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b
(see (2)) is deﬁned using the Chebyshev distance ∆associated with the right-hand side vector bof(S)(see Deﬁnition
2):
Cb={c∈[0,1]n×1|the system A/squaremax
minx=cis consistent and /ba∇dblb−c/ba∇dbl= ∆} ⊆ C. (13)
The author of [5] showed that we can directly obtain one vecto r inCb: the greatest Chebyshev approximation of the
right-hand side vector b:
/hatwideb=A/squaremax
min(At/squaremin
→Gb(∆))∈ Cb, (14)
whereb(∆) = [min(bi+∆,1)]1≤i≤n. So, we have /ba∇dblb−/hatwideb/ba∇dbl= ∆ and the system A/squaremax
minx=/hatwidebis consistent. Obtaining
the minimal Chebyshev approximations of bis possible with a method developed in [5], but minimal appro ximations
are more expensive to obtain in terms of computational cost t han the greatest Chebyshev approximation /hatwideb.
The author of [5] deﬁnes:
Deﬁnition 4. An approximate solution of the system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=bis a vector x∗such that the distance between
the vector c=A/squaremax
minx∗and the vector bis equal to ∆, i.e., we have /ba∇dblb−c/ba∇dbl= ∆ . Thus, the vector x∗is a solution
of a consistent system A/squaremax
minx=cdeﬁned with the matrix Aand the vector c, which is a Chebyshev approximation
ofb(Deﬁnition 3), i.e., we have c∈ Cb.
In [5], the author showed that we can directly obtain the grea test approximate solution of the system (S), which is the
following vector:
η=At/squaremin
→Gb(∆). (15)
Of course, the greatest approximate solution ηof the system (S)is the greatest solution of the consistent system
A/squaremax
minx=/hatwideb. In [5], the author describes how to obtain a set of minimal ap proximate solutions.
Example 2. Let a max-min system A/squaremax
minx=bbe deﬁned by:
A=/bracketleftBigg0.04 0.73 0.50
0.33 0.35 0.94
0.55 0.90 0.35/bracketrightBigg
andb=/bracketleftBigg0.30
0.42
0.76/bracketrightBigg
(16)
We compute the Chebyshev distance ∆, see (11), associated with the right-hand side vector bof the max-min system
A/squaremax
minx=b:
∆ = max
1≤i≤3δA
i
where:
δA
1= min(δ(1,1),δ(1,2),δ(1,3)) = min(0 .26,0,0) = 0,
δA
2= min(δ(2,1),δ(2,2),δ(2,3)) = min(0 .09,0.07,0.06)= 0.06,
δA
3= min(δ(3,1),δ(3,2),δ(3,3)) = min(0 .21,0.23,0.41)= 0.21.
5
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
Therefore, we obtain ∆ = 0.21, so, from (12), the system A/squaremax
minx=bis inconsistent. Let us compute b(∆) =/bracketleftBigg0.51
0.63
0.97/bracketrightBigg
and the greatest Chebyshev approximation of b, see (14):
/hatwideb=A/squaremax
min(At/squaremin

0.63
0.55/bracketrightBigg
.
One can check that /ba∇dblb−/hatwideb/ba∇dbl= ∆ and that the system A/squaremax
minx=/hatwidebis consistent.
We compute the greatest approximate solution of the inconsi stent system A/squaremax
minx=b, see (15):
η=At/squaremin
→Gb(∆) =/bracketleftBigg1.0
0.51
0.63/bracketrightBigg
.
One can check that ηis the greatest solution of the consistent system A/squaremax
minx=/hatwideb.
3 On minimally modifying the matrix of an inconsistent max-m in system
In this section, we present our problem formally: how to mini mally modify the matrix Aof size(n,m)of an inconsis-
tent max-min system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b, see (2), in order to obtain a consistent system, while keepi ng the right-hand
side vector bunchanged.
For this purpose, we introduce the following set, which is fo rmed by the matrices of size (n,m)governing the consis-
tent max-min systems which use the same right-hand side vect or: the right-hand side vector bof the system (S):
T={T∈[0,1]n×m|the system T/squaremax
minx=bis consistent }. (17)
It is easy to see that the particular matrix T= [tkl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤mwhose coefﬁcients are tkl:=bk, belongs to the set
T. Therefore Tis a non-empty set.
For eachp∈ {1,2,∞}, we deﬁne the distance from the ﬁxed matrix Ato the set Tas:
˚∆p:= inf
T∈T/ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp. (18)
Here,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblpdenotes the matrix norm with exponent p, namely, for a matrix X= [xij]∈Rn×m:

Our aim is to compute matrices in the set T, i.e., matrices governing consistent max-min systems whos e right-hand
side vector is b, which are the closest to the matrix Aof the system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=baccording to the distance ˚∆p.
We also study how to compute the distance ˚∆pwith respect to paccording to the coefﬁcients of Aandb.
In this section, we present some preliminary results and too ls that will be useful for constructing matrices in the set T
in subsequent sections. We show that the matrices of the set Tdeﬁned in (17) dominate in a certain sense the auxiliary
matrices noted A(i,j)associated with pairs of indices (i,j)∈ {1,2,...,n} × {1,2,...,m}, that we introduce in
Deﬁnition 5. We establish useful properties of these auxili ary matrices A(i,j)for our problem.
Lemma 2. The formula (18) can be rewritten as:
˚∆p= min
T∈T/ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp.
The proof is given in Subsection A.1.
We deduce the following equivalence, which is analog to (12) :

Corollary 1.
˚∆p= 0⇐⇒ the system (S)is consistent. (20)
3.1 Constructing the auxiliary matrices A(i,j)from the matrix Aof the inconsistent system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b
We introduce the following notations associated with the sy stem(S) :A/squaremax
minx=b, see (2).
Notation 3. Let us use the following set of indices:
I={1,2,···,n}andJ={1,2,...,m}. (21)
For all(i,j)∈I×J, a given matrix T= [tij]1≤i≤n,1≤j≤m∈[0,1]n×mand the right-hand side vector bof the
system(S), we deﬁne the following set using the function σG, see (6):
UT
ij:={k∈I|σG(bi,tkj,bk)>0}. (22)
Using (6), we get the following equivalent deﬁnition of the s etUT
ij:
UT
ij={k∈I|θ(i,k)·(tkj−bk)+>0}whereθ:I×I/mapsto→ {0,1}:θ(i,k) =/braceleftbigg1ifbi> bk
0otherwise.(23)
In particular, for any pair of indices (i,j)∈I×J, we can compute the set UA
ijusing the matrix Aof the system (S).
From the formula of the Chebyshev distance ∆ = max 1≤i≤nδA
i, see (11), associated with the right-hand side vector
bof the system (S), we set:
Ncons:={i∈I|δA
i= 0}andNinc:=Ncons={i∈I|δA
i>0}. (24)
The two disjoint sets NconsandNincform a partition of the set Iassociated with the pair (A,b). We know by (12) that
the equality Ncons=Iis equivalent to the consistency of the system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b.
Deﬁnition 5. For any ﬁxed pair of indices (i,j)∈I×J, we deﬁne the matrix A(i,j):=/bracketleftBig

The matrix A(i,j)is derived from the matrix Abyonly modifying some entries in the column with index j. Speciﬁcally,
we have:
∀(k,l)∈I×J, a(i,j)
kl∈ {bk,akl}. (26)
We begin by establishing some useful properties of the scala rsδA(i,j)(s,l), which is computed using (8) and associated
with the matrix A(i,j)and the right-hand side vector b:
Lemma 3. Let(i,j)∈I×Jbe a ﬁxed pair of indices. Then, we have:
1.δA(i,j)(i,j) = 0 .
2. For all 1≤s≤n, we have:

Any matrix T= [tkl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤msatisfying δT(i,j) = 0 for a given pair of indices (i,j)∈I×Jdominates the
auxiliary matrix A(i,j)in the following sense: the distance |tkl−akl|between a coefﬁcient tklof the matrix Tand the
corresponding coefﬁcient aklof the original matrix A= [akl]is always at least as large as the distance |a(i,j)

3.2 Constructing the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)from the matrix Aof the inconsistent system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b
In this subsection, we generalize the construction of auxil iary matrices A(i,j)associated with pairs (i,j)∈I×Jto
pairs of index uplets (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈Ih×Jhwhere1≤h≤n, see (27). In the next section, Theorem 1 will show that
for speciﬁc pairs (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)obtained with the construction (27) belong to the set T, see (17), i.e., using
these speciﬁc pairs (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)are matrices governing consistent max-min systems whose ri ght-hand
side vector is the right-hand side vector bof the system (S).
3.2.1 Iterative construction of the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
Lethbe an integer satisfying 1≤h≤nwheren=card(I), where the set Iis deﬁned in Notation 3, along with the
setJ.
Deﬁnition 6. For anyh-tuple⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)∈Ihconsisting of two-by-two distinct indices from the set I(i.e.,
for allu,v∈ {1,2,...,h}withu/\e}atio\slash=v,iu/\e}atio\slash=iv) and ah-tuple⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)∈Jhof indices of the set J, we
associate the matrix denoted A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)which is constructed by successively applying the modiﬁcat ions indicated by the
pairs(i1,j1),(i2,j2),...,(ih,jh)(using Deﬁnition 5) as follows:
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=/braceleftbiggA(i1,j1)ifh= 1,
C(ih,jh)ifh >1andC:=A(i1,j1)∗(i2,j2)∗···∗(ih−1,jh−1).(27)
.
In (27), the matrix Cis the intermediate matrix obtained by successively applyi ng the modiﬁcations corresponding
to the pairs (i1,j1),(i2,j2),...,(ih−1,jh−1)to the original matrix A. Then, the ﬁnal matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)is obtained by
applying the modiﬁcation (ih,jh)toC. This construction can also be written as
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= (((A(i1,j1))(i2,j2))(i3,j3)···)(ih,jh).
3.2.2 Properties of the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
By induction on h, one can verify the following properties:
Proposition 1.
1. For every (k,l)∈I×J,
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl∈ {bk, akl}.
2. For every k∈Iand for every l /∈ {j1,j2,...,j h},
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=akl.
10
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
These properties extend those of the matrices A(i,j)given in (25a), (25b) and (26). They ensure that the modiﬁcat ions
introduced by A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)affect only the columns indexed by j1,j2,...,j h, while all other coefﬁcients of the matrix A
remain unchanged.
The following result generalizes Lemma 5 in the following se nse:
Proposition 2. Let⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)∈Ihbe anh-tuple of two-by-two distinct indices of the set Iand⊳vectorj=
(j1,j2,...,j h)∈Jh. For any permutation πof the set {1,2,...,h}i.e.,π:{1,2,...,h} → {1,2,...,h}:λ/mapsto→iλ,
deﬁne
⊳vectori⊳π=/parenleftbig
iπ(1),iπ(2),...,iπ(h)/parenrightbig
and⊳vectorj ⊳π=/parenleftbig
jπ(1),jπ(2),...,j π(h)/parenrightbig
. (28)
Then, the matrix obtained by successively modifying Ausing the pairs (i1,j1),(i2,j2),...,(ih,jh)is identical to the
matrix obtained by applying these modiﬁcations in any permu ted order; that is,
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A(⊳vectori⊳π,⊳vectorj⊳π), (29)
or equivalently,
A(i1,j1)∗(i2,j2)∗···∗(ih,jh)=A(iπ(1),jπ(1))∗(iπ(2),jπ(2))∗···∗(iπ(h),jπ(h)).
Proposition 2 allows us to generalize Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 to th e matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj). We rely on the scalars δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l)
(resp.δA(s,l)), which are associated with the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)(resp.A), see (8).
Proposition 3. LetA= [akl]∈[0,1]n×m,⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)∈Ihbe anh-tuple of two-by-two distinct indices and
⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h)∈Jh. We construct the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤musing (27). We have:
1. For all (k,l)∈I×J, we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl∈ {bk,akl}.
2. For all λ∈ {1,...,h}, we have δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(iλ,jλ) = 0 .
3. For all s∈Iand for all l∈ {j1,j2,...,j h}, we have δA(s,l) = 0 =⇒δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l) = 0 .
4. For all s∈Iand for all l /∈ {j1,j2,...,j h}, we have δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l) =δA(s,l).
Proposition 4. LetA= [akl]∈[0,1]n×m, Let⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)∈Ihbe anh-tuple of two-by-two distinct indices
of the set Iand⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h)∈Jh. We construct the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]using (27). For any matrix
T∈[0,1]n×mverifying δT(iλ,jλ) = 0 for allλ∈ {1,2,...,h}, we have:
∀(k,l)∈I×J,|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl−akl|≤|tkl−akl|. (30)
It clearly follows that:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblpforp∈ {1,2,∞}.
The proofs of Propositions 1, 2, 3 and 4 are given in Subsectio n A.3.
3.2.3 Computing the coefﬁcients of A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
Let us consider (⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih),⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h))a pair of h-tuples as in Deﬁnition 6. In the following, we
present a method for computing the coefﬁcients of the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)in a simpler way than the construction provided
in (27).
We introduce three sets E1,E2andEof index pairs that depend on A,band(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj):
1. The set E1is formed by the pairs (iλ,jλ)whereλ∈ {1,2,...,h}for which the corresponding component
biλof the right-hand side vector bis strictly greater than the entry aiλjλof the matrix A:
E1:={(iλ,jλ)∈I×J|λ∈ {1,...,h}andbiλ> aiλjλ}. (31a)
2. The set E2is deﬁned using the sets UA
iλjλ={k∈I|σG(biλ,akjλ,bk)>0},see (22):
E2:=h/uniondisplay
λ=1{(k,jλ)|k∈UA
iλjλ} ⊆I×J. (31b)
11
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
3. Finally, the set Eis deﬁned as the union of the previous two sets:
E:=E1∪E2⊆I×J. (31c)
Note that for every pair (k,l)wherek∈Iandl∈J\{j1,j2,...,j h}, we have (k,l)/∈ E, since both E1andE2only
contain pairs with the second component equal to one of j1,...,j h.
Let us ﬁx an index λ∈ {1,2,...,h}and deﬁne the reduced (h−1)-tuples⊳vectori′and⊳vectorj′by removing the λ-th component
from⊳vectoriand⊳vectorj, respectively. We need to establish relationships between the setsE1,E2,E, associated to the original pair
(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), and the sets E′
1,E′
2,E′, associated to the reduced pair (⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′).
Set⊳vectori′= (i′
1,i′
2,...,i′
h−1)and⊳vectorj′= (j′
1,j′
2,...,j′
h−1).We have for every λ′∈ {1,2,...,h−1}:

iλ′, ifλ′≤λ−1,
iλ′+1,ifλ′≥λ,j′
λ′=/braceleftBigg
jλ′, ifλ′≤λ−1,
jλ′+1,ifλ′≥λ.
The setsE′
1,E′
2,E′associated with the matrix A, the right-hand side vector bof the system (S)and the pair of (h−1)-
tuples(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′), are the following subsets of I×J:
E′

It is clear from the deﬁnitions of the sets E1,E2, andEthat the following properties hold.
Lemma 6. Let(⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih),⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h))be a pair of h-tuples as in Deﬁnition 6. For h >1, letE1,
E2, andEbe the sets associated to the pair (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)as in (31). Given a ﬁxed index λ∈ {1,2,...,h}, let(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)denote
the pair obtained by removing the λ-th component from (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj). Then, the corresponding sets E′
1,E′

satisfy:
1.E′
1=E1\{(iλ,jλ)},
2.E′
2⊆ E2,
3.E′=E′

The setE, see (31), allows us to construct the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), see (27), in a simpler way:
Proposition 5. Let(⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih),⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h))be a pair of h-tuples as in Deﬁnition 6.
Then, the coefﬁcients of the modiﬁed matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)

for every (k,l)∈I×J, a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)

akl,if(k,l)/∈ E.
The proof is by induction on h≥1, see Section A.3.
TheL∞distance/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞can be easily computed using:
Corollary 2. Let(⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih),⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h))be a pair of h-tuples as in Deﬁnition 6.
Then, we have:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞= max
1≤λ≤h/ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞ (33)

4 Main results on constructing consistent systems by minima lly modifying the matrix of
an inconsistent max-min system
In this section, we establish our main results for handling t he inconsistency of a max-min system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b
by constructing consistent systems close to the system (S): for each obtained consistent system that we obtain, its
right-hand side vector is the right-hand side vector bof the system (S)while its matrix is of the form A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)(Deﬁnition
6) and is obtained by minimal modiﬁcations of the matrix Aof the system (S), see Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.
From these results, we compute the distance ˚∆p, see (18), in a simpler way, see Corollary 3. Furthermore, wh en using
theL∞norm, i.e., p=∞, we give an explicit analytical formula (Corollary 4) for co mputing the distance ˚∆∞, see
(18). Finally, we provide a method to construct a non-empty a nd ﬁnite subset of matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)whose distance to the
matrixAof the inconsistent system is equal to the scalar ˚∆∞, see (37).
4.1 Constructing consistent systems close to the initial in consistent system (S)
We show that for some pairs (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)constructed from Aandbwith (27), yields a consistent max-min
system whose matrix is A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)and its right-hand side vector is still the vector bof the system (S):
Theorem 1. We use the non-empty set Nincwithh:= card(Ninc), see (24). Choose an arbitrary enumeration of Ninc
as{i1,i2,...,ih}and set⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih). Then, for every h-tuple⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)∈Jh, the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
constructed with (27) yields a consistent system, which is:
(S(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)) :A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/squaremax
minx=b.
Therefore, the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)belongs to the set Tsee (17).
Forp∈ {1,2,∞}, we have:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp≥˚∆p,
see (18) for the deﬁnition of ˚∆p.
The following result highlights the minimality of the modiﬁ cations made to obtain the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)fromAusing
(27) and an h-tuple⊳vectorias in Theorem 1:
Theorem 2. Retain the notations from Theorem 1 and let
A= [akl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤mand⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)such that Ninc={i1,i2,...,ih}
Then, for every consistent system whose right-hand side vec tor isb:
T/squaremax
minx=b,withT= [tkl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m∈ T,
there exists an h-tuple⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)∈Jhsuch that the system
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/squaremax
minx=b
13
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
is consistent and, for every (k,l)∈I×J,
|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl−akl| ≤ |tkl−akl|whereA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m.
We have:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp forp∈ {1,2,∞}.
The above theorem allows us to compute the distance ˚∆p, see (18), using the ﬁnite set Jhinstead of T:
Corollary 3. Recall that for p∈ {1,2,∞}we deﬁned in (18):
˚∆p:= inf
T∈T/ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp.
Then, it follows from Theorems 1 and 2 that
˚∆p= min
⊳vectorj∈Jh/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp. (34)
Moreover, this minimum is independent of the particular enu meration {i1,i2,...,ih}of the set Nincchosen to deﬁne
theh-tuple⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih).
The proofs of Theorem 1 and 2 and Corollary 3 are given in Subse ction A.4.
4.2 Computing the distance ˚∆∞by an explicit analytical formula
In the following, using the L∞norm i.e, p=∞, we aim to construct a matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), see (27), such that
˚∆∞=/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞, (35)
where˚∆∞is deﬁned in (18) and Ais the matrix of the inconsistent system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b. This construction will
allow us to introduce an explicit analytical formula for com puting the distance ˚∆∞.
Our ﬁrst objective is to ﬁnd a pair (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)satisfying the equality (35). We process as follows:
• We choose an arbitrary enumeration of Nincas{i1,i2,...,ih}, see (24), and set ⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih).
• To theh-uplet⊳vectori:= (i1,...,ih), we associate an h-uplet⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)whose components satisfy the
following requirement: for each λ∈ {1,2,...,h}, set
jλ:= argminj∈J/ba∇dblA(iλ,j)−A/ba∇dbl∞,which means that /ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞= min
j∈J/ba∇dblA(iλ,j)−A/ba∇dbl∞.(36)
The above method allows us to introduce the following set of p airs(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj):

whereJ:I→2J:i→ {j∈J| /ba∇dblA(i,j)−A/ba∇dbl∞= min

From Theorem 1, we know that for any (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈LA,∞, we have A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈ T , i.e., the system A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/squaremax

consistent and therefore ˚∆∞≤ /ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞. The following theorem is the main step to compute ˚∆∞by an explicit
analytical formula:
Theorem 3. Let(S) =A/squaremax
minx=bbe an inconsistent system. Then, for any (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈LA,∞(see (37)), we have:

2.˚∆∞= max 1≤λ≤h/ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞where⊳vectori= (i1,...,ih)and⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h).
We give an explicit analytical formula for computing the dis tance˚∆∞:

The formula (38) can be reformulated using the set Ninc, see (24):

The formula (38) of ˚∆∞is useful for estimating to which extent the system (S)is inconsistent, with respect to its
matrixA. Analogously, using ∆, see (11), we can measure how inconsistent the system (S)is, with respect to its
right-hand side vector b. It is easy to see that we have ∆≤˚∆∞for any max-min system (S).

The best vector pairs (minimizing /ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞) yield a value of 0.21. In our cases, these are:

Moreover, by choosing

we obtain these vector pairs which results in the best norm /ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞= 0.21.
5 Analogous results for a system of min-max fuzzy relational equations
In [5], we showed how to switch from a system of min-max fuzzy r elational equations to a system of max-min
fuzzy relational equations. This equivalence is based on th e transformation t→1−t, which allowed us to show
that studying a system of max-min fuzzy relational equation s is equivalent to studying a system of min-max fuzzy
relational equations, see [5] for more details.
In this section, using the same notations as in [5], we begin b y reminding how to solve a system of min-max fuzzy
relational equations. Given an inconsistent system of min- max fuzzy relational equations, we study how to obtain
consistent min-max systems close to the inconsistent syste m by minimally modifying the matrix of the inconsistent
system. We introduce new tools for a system of min-max fuzzy r elational equations corresponding to those already
introduced for a system of max-min fuzzy relational equatio ns and we show their correspondences in Table 1.

5.1 Solving systems of min-max fuzzy relational equations
Let us use:
Notation 4.
•To any matrix A= [aij], we associate the matrix A◦:= [a◦
ij]wherea◦
ij:= 1−aij. Clearly, we have
(A◦)◦=A.
•The min-max matrix product /squaremin
maxuses the function max as the product and the function min as the addition
and for any matrices AandBof size(n,p)and(p,m)respectively, we have:
(A/squaremax
minB)◦=A◦/squaremin
maxB◦. (39)
•Themax−ǫmatrix product /squaremax
ǫuses theǫ-product deﬁned by:
xǫy=/braceleftbigg
yifx < y
0ifx≥yin[0,1].
as the product and the function max as the addition.
Let us use the following system of min-max fuzzy relational e quations:
G/squaremin
maxx=d (40)
where
G= [gij]1≤i≤n,1≤j≤m∈[0,1]n×m, d= [di]1≤i≤n,andx= [xj]1≤j≤m∈[0,1]mis the unknown vector .
To check if the min-max system G/squaremin
maxx=dis consistent, we compute the following vector:
r=Gt/squaremax
ǫd, (41)
whereGtis the transpose of Gand we use the max−ǫmatrix product /squaremax
ǫ(Notation 4). The vector ris the potential
lowest solution of the system G/squaremin
maxx=d.
Sanchez’s result [29] ((reminded in (4)) for solving of a sys tem max-min fuzzy relational equations becomes the
following one for solving a system of min-max fuzzy relation al equations:
The system G/squaremin
maxx=dis consistent ⇐⇒G/squaremin
maxr=d. (42)
The structure of the solution set of a system of min-max fuzzy relational equations is as follows. If the system
G/squaremin
maxx=dis consistent, the vector r=Gt/squaremax
ǫdis the lowest solution of the system, and the system has a ﬁnit e
number of maximal solutions.
To handle the inconsistency of a min-max system, the author o f [5] studied the Chebyshev distance associated with
the right-hand side vector dof the system G/squaremin
maxx=d:
∇=∇(G,d) = min
w∈W/ba∇dbld−w/ba∇dbl∞whereW={w∈[0,1]n×1|the system G/squaremin
maxx=wis consistent }. (43)
[5] computes by an explicit analytical formula the Chebyshe v distance ∇:
∇= max
1≤i≤n∇G
i (44)
where for i= 1,2,...n :
∇G
i= min
1≤j≤mmax[(gij−di)+,max
1≤k≤nσǫ(di,gkj,dk)] (45)
and
σǫ(u,v,w) = min((w−u)+
2,(w−v)+) =σG(u◦,v◦,w◦). (46)
wherex◦:= 1−xfor anyx∈[0,1]and the function σGis deﬁned in (6).
Similarly to the case of an inconsistent max-min system, the author of [5] studies how to obtain approximate solutions
of an inconsistent min-max system G/squaremin
maxx=dand Chebyshev approximations of the right-hand side vector dof
this system.

unchanged. This study is analogous to that carried out for a m ax-min system A/squaremax

maxx=d:
Q:={Q∈[0,1]n×m|the system Q/squaremin

For eachp∈ {1,2,∞}, we deﬁne the distance from the matrix Gto the set Qas:
˚∇p:= inf

Here,/ba∇dbl · /ba∇dblpdenotes the matrix norm with exponent p. The set Qand the distance ˚∇pare deﬁned for the min-max

We rely on the max-min system A/squaremax
minx=bequivalent to the min-max system G/squaremin
maxx=din the following sense:
Deﬁnition 7. To the min-max system G/squaremin
maxx=d, see (40), we associate the following max-min system:
A/squaremax
minx=bwhereA:=G◦andb:=d◦. (49)
We notice that we have /ba∇dblA−B/ba∇dblp=/ba∇dblA◦−B◦/ba∇dblpfor any matrices AandBof size(n,m)(see Notation 4). Therefore,
we easily deduce from (39) and Lemma 2 that:
Lemma 7. SetA:=G◦andb:=d◦, then we have:
1.Q=T◦whereT◦:={T◦|T∈ T } , see (17) and (47).

We reuse the sets of indices I={1,2,···,n}andJ={1,2,...,m}to put some notations:
Notation 5. For all(i,j)∈I×J, using the matrix Gand the right-hand side vector dof the system G/squaremin

we put:

whereσǫis deﬁned in (46). Thus, we have:
VG
ij=UA
ij (51)
whereUA
ijis the set associated with the max-min system (49) as in (22).
From the formula for computing the Chebyshev distance ∇associated with the right-hand side vector dof the system
G/squaremin
maxx=d, see (44), we set:
Mcons:={i∈I| ∇i= 0}andMinc:={i∈I| ∇i>0}andh:=card(Minc). (52)
Thus, we have:
Mcons=Ncons andMinc=Ninc (53)
whereNconsandNincare the sets associated with the max-min system (49) as in (24 ).
For any pair (i,j)∈I×J, we deﬁne an auxiliary matrix G(i,j)using the set VG

Deﬁnition 8. For any pair (i,j)∈I×J, we construct an auxiliary matrix G(i,j)= [g(i,j)

The above deﬁnitions of the coefﬁcients of the auxiliary mat rixG(i,j)correspond to the deﬁnitions (25a) and (25b) of
the coefﬁcients of the auxiliary matrix A(i,j)associated with the max-min system A/squaremax
minx=b(49):
for all(i,j)∈I×J, we have G(i,j)= [A(i,j)]◦. (55)
We generalize the construction of auxiliary matrices G(i,j)associated with pairs (i,j)∈I×Jto pairs of index uplets
(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈Ih×Jhwhere1≤h≤n:
Deﬁnition 9. For anyh-tuple⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)of two-by-two distinct indices of the set Iand anh-tuple⊳vectorj=
(j1,j2,...,j h)of indices of the set J, we associate the matrix denoted G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)which is constructed by successively
applying the modiﬁcations indicated by the pairs (i1,j1),(i2,j2),...,(ih,jh), as follows:
G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=/braceleftbiggG(i1,j1)ifh= 1,
Y(ih,jh)ifh >1andY:=G(i1,j1)∗(i2,j2)∗···∗(ih−1,jh−1).(56)
This construction can also be written as
G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= (((G(i1,j1))(i2,j2))(i3,j3)···)(ih,jh).
By induction on h, we easily generalize (55):
G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)]◦(57)
whereA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)is introduced in Deﬁnition 6.
We give a simpler construction of the matrices G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj). For any h-tuple⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)of two-by-two distinct
indices of the set Iand anh-tuple⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)of indices of the set J, using the sets VG
ijdeﬁned in (50), we
construct the following sets:

Using the equalities VG

where the sets E1,E2andE, see (31), are associated with the max-min system A/squaremax
minx=bequivalent to the min-max
G/squaremin
maxx=d(see Deﬁnition 7). Thus, using (57) and Proposition 5, we eas ily get:
Proposition 6. For anyh-tuple⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)of two-by-two distinct indices of the set Iand anh-tuple⊳vectorj=
(j1,j2,...,j h)of indices of the set J, we have:
∀(k,l)∈I×J, g(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=/braceleftbiggdkif(k,l)∈ F
gklif(k,l)/∈ F. (60)
Using the max-min system A/squaremax
minx=bequivalent to the min-max system G/squaremin
maxx=d(see Deﬁnition 7), we
deduce the main results for the min-max system G/squaremin
maxx=d:
Theorem 4. We use the set Mincwhereh:= card( Minc), see (52). Choose an arbitrary enumeration of Mincas
{i1,i2,...,ih}and set⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih). Then, for every h-tuple⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)∈Jh, the matrix G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
constructed with (56) yields a consistent system, which is:
G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/squaremin
maxx=d.
Therefore, the matrix G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)belongs to the set Q, see (47), i.e., G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈ Q.
Forp∈ {1,2,∞}, we have:
/ba∇dblG(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−G/ba∇dblp≥˚∇p,
see (48) for the deﬁnition of ˚∇p.
The proof relies on (53), (57) and Theorem 1.
The following result highlights the minimality of the modiﬁ cations made to obtain the matrices G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)fromGusing
(56) and an h-tuple⊳vectorias in Theorem 4:
Theorem 5. Retain the notations from Theorem 4 and let
G= [gkl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤mand⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)such that Minc={i1,i2,...,ih}.
Then, for every consistent min-max system whose right-hand side vector is d:
T′/squaremin
maxx=d, withT′= [t′
kl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m∈ Q,
there exists an h-tuple⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)∈Jhsuch that the system
G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/squaremin
maxx=d
is consistent and, for every (k,l)∈I×J,
|g(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl−gkl| ≤ |t′
kl−gkl|whereG(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [g(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m.
We have:
/ba∇dblG(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−G/ba∇dblp≤ /ba∇dblT′−G/ba∇dblp forp∈ {1,2,∞}.
The proof relies on (53), (57) and Theorem 2.
The above theorem allows us to compute the distance ˚∇p, see (48), using the ﬁnite set Jhinstead of Q:
Corollary 5. Recall that for p∈ {1,2,∞}we deﬁned in (48):
˚∇p:= inf
Q∈Q/ba∇dblQ−G/ba∇dblp.
Then, it follows from Theorems 4 and 5 that
˚∇p= min
⊳vectorj∈Jh/ba∇dblG(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−G/ba∇dblp. (61)
Moreover, this minimum is independent of the particular enu meration {i1,i2,...,ih}of the set Mincchosen to deﬁne
theh-tuple⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih).

In the rest of this section, using the L∞norm i.e, p=∞, we introduce a method for constructing a matrix G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), see

˚∇∞=/ba∇dblG(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−G/ba∇dbl∞, (62)
This construction will allow us to introduce an explicit ana lytical formula (Corollary 6) for computing the distance
˚∇∞, see (48).
We rely on the max-min system A/squaremax
minx=bequivalent to the min-max G/squaremin
maxx=d(see Deﬁnition 7). We note
that we have ˚∇∞=˚∆∞where˚∆∞is the distance associated with the system A/squaremax
minx=b, see (18).
To ﬁnd a pair (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)satisfying the equality (62), we process as follows:
• We choose an arbitrary enumeration of Mincas{i1,i2,...,ih}, see (52), and set ⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih).
• To theh-uplet⊳vectori:= (i1,...,ih), we associate an h-uplet⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)whose components satisfy the
following requirement: for each λ∈ {1,2,...,h}, set
jλ:= argminj∈J/ba∇dblG(iλ,j)−G/ba∇dbl∞,which means that /ba∇dblG(iλ,jλ)−G/ba∇dbl∞= min
j∈J/ba∇dblG(iλ,j)−G/ba∇dbl∞.(63)
The above method allows us to introduce the following set of p airs(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj):
PG,∞=/braceleftBig
(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle⊳vectori= (i1,...,ih)is any ordering of Minc,
⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h)withjλ∈ J′(iλ)for eachλ= 1,...,h/bracerightBig
, (64)
whereJ′:I→2J:i→ {j∈J| /ba∇dblG(i,j)−G/ba∇dbl∞= min j′∈J/ba∇dblG(i,j′)−G/ba∇dbl∞}.
From (53) and (55), we easily deduce the equality PG,∞=LA,∞whereLA,∞is deﬁne in (37).
From Theorem 4, we know that for any (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈PG,∞, we have G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈ Q , i.e., the system G(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/squaremax
minx=dis
consistent and therefore ˚∇∞≤ /ba∇dblG(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−G/ba∇dbl∞. We easily deduce from the second statment of Lemma 7 , (57) an d
Theorem 3, the following theorem which is the main step to com pute˚∇∞by an explicit analytical formula:
Theorem 6. LetG/squaremin
maxx=dbe an inconsistent system. Then, for any (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈PG,∞, we have:
1.˚∇∞=/ba∇dblG(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−G/ba∇dbl∞.
2.˚∇∞= max 1≤λ≤h/ba∇dblG(iλ,jλ)−G/ba∇dbl∞where⊳vectori= (i1,...,ih)and⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h).
We give an explicit analytical formula for computing the dis tance˚∇∞using Corollary 4:
Corollary 6. For any system G/squaremin
maxx=d, we have:
˚∇∞= max
i∈Imin
j∈Jmax/bracketleftBig
(gij−di)+,max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i/parenleftBig
θ′(i,k)·(dk−gkj)+/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig
(65)
whereθ′:I×I/mapsto→ {0,1}:θ′(i,k) =/braceleftbigg1ifdi< dk
0otherwise.
The formula (65) can be reformulated using the set Minc, see (52):
˚∇∞= max
i∈Mincmin
j∈Jmax/bracketleftBig
(gij−di)+,max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i/parenleftBig
θ′(i,k)·(dk−gkj)+/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig
.
The distance ˚∇∞is useful for estimating to which extent the min-max system G/squaremin
maxx=dis inconsistent, with
respect to its matrix G. Analogously, using ∇, see (44), we can measure how inconsistent the min-max syste m
G/squaremin
maxx=dis with respect to its right-hand side vector d. It is easy to see that we have ∇ ≤˚∇∞for the min-max
systemG/squaremin
maxx=d.

6 Conclusion
In this article, we handled the inconsistency of a system of m ax-min fuzzy relational equations by modifying the
matrix governing the system. Our main results (Theorem 1 and Theorem 2) allows us to obtain consistent systems
that closely approximate the original inconsistent system in the following sense: the right-hand side vector of each
consistent system is that of the inconsistent system, and th e coefﬁcients of the matrix governing each consistent
system are obtained by modifying, exactly and minimally, th e entries of the original matrix that must be corrected to
achieve consistency, while leaving all other entries uncha nged. The solutions of the obtained consistent systems can
be considered as approximate solutions of the inconsistent system. We studied the distance ˚∆p(in terms of a norm
amongL1,L2orL∞) between the matrix of the inconsistent system and the set fo rmed by the matrices of consistent
systems that use the same right-hand side vector as the incon sistent system, see (18). We showed in Theorem 3 that
our method allows us to directly compute matrices of consist ent systems that use the same right-hand side vector as
the inconsistent system whose distance in terms of L∞norm to the matrix of the inconsistent system is minimal (the
computational costs are higher when using L1norm orL2norm, see Corollary 3). We also give an explicit analytical
formula for computing ˚∆∞, see Corollary 4. Finally, we translated our results for min -max systems.
This work may be useful for solving inconsistency issues in m ax-min systems involved in max-min learning methods,
such as learning the rule parameters of possibilistic rule- based systems [2], learning associate memories [32], or
learning capacities of Sugeno integrals according to train ing data [3]. It can also be useful for applications based on
max-min systems, e.g. spatial analysis [12], diagnostic pr oblems [16].

A Proofs
A.1 Proof of the result in Section 3
Lemma 2. The formula (18) can be rewritten as:
˚∆p= min
T∈T/ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp.
Proof. By applying (11) and (12) to any matrix T, we deduce the equality:
T={T∈[0,1]n×m|for alli∈ {1,2,...,n}we haveδT
i= 0}.
Using Lemma 1, we conclude that Tis a non-empty closed subset of [0,1]n×m. Since[0,1]n×mis compact and the
norm/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblpis continuous, the function T/mapsto→ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblpattains its minimum on T. Therefore,
˚∆p= min
T∈T/ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp.
A.2 Proof of the results in Section 3.1
Lemma 3. Let(i,j)∈I×Jbe a ﬁxed pair of indices. Then, we have:
1.δA(i,j)(i,j) = 0 .
2. For all 1≤s≤n, we have:
δA(s,j) = 0 =⇒δA(i,j)(s,j) = 0.
3. For all 1≤s≤nand1≤l/\e}atio\slash=j≤m, we have:
δA(i,j)(s,l) =δA(s,l).
4./ba∇dblA(i,j)−A/ba∇dbl∞= max/bracketleftBig
(bi−aij)+,maxk∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i/parenleftBig
θ(i,k)·(akj−bk)+/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig
where the function θis deﬁned in (23).
Proof. LetA(i,j)= [a(i,j)
kl]. We remind that:
δA(i,j)(s,l) = max[( bs−a(i,j)
sl)+,max
1≤k≤nσG(bs,a(i,j)
kl,bk)]
and for every kwe havea(i,j)
kj∈ {bk,akj}, see (26).
1. First, we show that bi≤a(i,j)
ij. This inequality clearly follows from
a(i,j)
ij=/braceleftBigg
biifbi> aij
aijifbi≤aij,
see (25a). Moreover, for every kwe have:
σG(bi,a(i,j)
kj,bk) = 0.
This is evident (6) for k=i. Fork/\e}atio\slash=i, by (25a), we have:
a(i,j)
kj=/braceleftBigg
bk ifk∈UA
ij
akjifk /∈UA
ij.
Ifk∈UA
ijthen
σG(bi,a(i,j)
kj,bk) =σG(bi,bk,bk) = 0.
26
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
and ifk /∈UA
ijthen
σG(bi,a(i,j)
kj,bk) =σG(bi,akj,bk),
and by the deﬁnition (22) of UA
ijwe have
σG(bi,akj,bk) = 0.
Thus,δA(i,j)(i,j) = 0 .
2. Next, suppose that for 1≤s≤nwe have:
δA(s,j) := max[( bs−asj)+,max
1≤k≤nσG(bs,akj,bk)] = 0.
We show that δA(i,j)(s,j) = 0 . We may assume that s/\e}atio\slash=i.
As we have bs≤asjandσG(bs,akj,bk) = 0 for allk∈I, to establish the inequality bs≤a(i,j)
sjand that we
haveσG(bs,a(i,j)
kj,bk) = 0 for allk∈I, it sufﬁces to use (6) and note that a(i,j)
kj∈ {bk,akj}, see (26).
3. By (25b), for every l/\e}atio\slash=j, we have a(i,j)
kl=aklfor allk∈I.Thus by deﬁnition (8), we have:
δA(i,j)(s,l) =δA(s,l).
4. This equality is a consequence of the deﬁnition of the coef ﬁcients of the matrix A(i,j), see (25a) and (25b),
and of the following relationship based on (23):
max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=iθ(i,k)·(akj−bk)+= max
k∈UA
ij|a(i,j)
kj−akj|withmax
∅= 0.
Lemma 4. LetT= [tkl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤mbe a matrix such that δT(i,j) = 0 . Then, we have:
1.|a(i,j)
kl−akl|≤|tkl−akl|for all pairs (k,l)∈I×J,
2./ba∇dblA(i,j)−A/ba∇dblp≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblpforp∈ {1,2,∞}.
Proof. It is clear that the ﬁrst statement implies the second one.
To prove the ﬁrst statement, It sufﬁces to verify the inequal ity forl=j(see (25b)) and for k∈Isuch that a(i,j)
kj/\e}atio\slash=akj.
Using the hypothesis δT(i,j) = 0 , i.e.,bi≤tijandσG(bi,tkj,bk) = 0 for allk∈I, see (8), we observe:
• Ifk=i, then from (25a) we deduce that bi> aijandbi=a(i,j)
ij, hence
aij< bi=a(i,j)
ij≤tijwhich implies |a(i,j)
ij−aij| ≤ |tij−aij|.
• Ifk/\e}atio\slash=i, then by (25a) we have k∈UA
ij, i.e.,
σG(bi,akj,bk) = min/parenleftBig(bi−bk)+
2,(akj−bk)+/parenrightBig
>0,
anda(i,j)
kj=bk. The hypothesis σG(bi,tkj,bk) = 0 then implies that tkj≤bk, so that
tkj≤bk=a(i,j)
kj< akjwhich implies |a(i,j)
kj−akj| ≤ |tkj−akj|.

Proof. Note that the matrix A(i,j)is obtained by modifying the column with index jin the matrix A(see (25a) and
(25b)). Consequently, if j1/\e}atio\slash=j2, with such modiﬁcation, it is clear that the equality D=Fholds.
In the case where j1=j2, we setj:=j1=j2and show D=Fby computing the coefﬁcients explicitly. We
introduce the following notations for the matrices C,D,E , andFof size(n,m):
•C:=A(i1,j)= [ckl]andD:=C(i2,j)= [dkl].
•E:=A(i2,j)= [ekl]andF:=E(i1,j)= [fkl].
To prove D=F, it sufﬁces to compare the coefﬁcients in the j-th column of C,D,E andF, and show that the j-th
column of Dequals the j-th column of F.
In order to establish di2j=fi2janddi1j=fi1j, it is enough to prove di2j=fi2jand then, by swapping the roles of
i1andi2, we deduce di1j=fi1j. We now show di2j=fi2j.
According to (25a), we have
di2j=/braceleftbiggbi2ifbi2> ci2j
ci2jifbi2≤ci2j
and, since i2/\e}atio\slash=i1,
ci2j=/braceleftbiggbi2 ifi2∈UA
i1j
ai2jifi2/∈UA
i1j.
Moreover, again by (25a):
fi2j=/braceleftbiggbi2ifi2∈UE
i1j
ei2jifi2/∈UE
i1j, ei2j=/braceleftbiggbi2 ifbi2> ai2j,
ai2jifbi2≤ai2j.
Case 1:bi2> ai2j.
• We get ei2j=bi2, sofi2j=bi2.
• Since(ai2j−bi2)+= 0, from (6) and (22), it follows that i2/∈UA
i1j, thusci2j=ai2j< bi2, which implies
di2j=bi2=fi2j.
Case 2:bi2≤ai2j. Thenei2j=ai2j. We distinguish two subcases:
• Ifi2∈UA
i1j, thenci2j=bi2, sodi2j=bi2. Sinceei2j=ai2jandi2∈UA
i1j, it follows that i2∈UE
i1j, hence
fi2j=bi2=di2j.
• Ifi2/∈UA
i1j, thenci2j=ai2j≥bi2, sodi2j=ai2j. Butei2j=ai2jandi2/∈UA
i1jimplyi2/∈UE
i1j, so
fi2j=ei2j=ai2j=di2j.
Thus we have shown di2j=fi2j. By interchanging i1andi2, we also obtain di1j=fi1j.
Next, letk /∈ {i1,i2}. We will prove dkj=fkjby considering the two cases k∈UA
i1jork /∈UA
i1j. From (25a), we
have
dkj=/braceleftbiggbkifk∈UC
i2j
ckjifk /∈UC
i2j, ckj=/braceleftbiggbk ifk∈UA

akjifk /∈UA

and
fkj=/braceleftbiggbk ifk∈UE
i1j
ekjifk /∈UE
i1j, ekj=/braceleftbiggbk ifk∈UA
i2j
akjifk /∈UA
i2j.
Case A:k∈UA
i1j. ThenσG(bi1,akj,bk) = min/parenleftBig(bi1−bk)+
2,(akj−bk)+/parenrightBig
>0, which implies bi1> bkandakj> bk.
Therefore ckj=bkanddkj=bk.
• Ifk∈UE
i1j, thenfkj=bk=dkj.
28

• Ifk /∈UE
i1j, thenfkj=ekjand since σG(bi1,ekj,bk) = 0 , we get ekj≤bk. As by (26), we have
ekj∈ {bk,akj}, frombk< akj, we obtain ekj=bk, hencefkj=ekj=bk=dkj.
Case B:k /∈UA
i1j. ThenσG(bi1,akj,bk) = min/parenleftBig(bi1−bk)+
2,(akj−bk)+/parenrightBig
= 0andckj=akj.
• Ifk∈UA
i2j, thenekj=bkand from (6) and (22), we deduce akj> bkandk∈UC
i2j. Hencedkj=bk< akj
andbi1≤bk, which implies k /∈UE
i1j, so ﬁnally fkj=ekj=bk=dkj.
• Ifk /∈UA
i2j, thenekj=akj=ckj, so by (22) , we deduce k /∈UE
i1jandk /∈UC
i2j, leading to dkj=ckj=
ekj=fkj.
A.3 Proof of the results in Section 3.2
Proposition 1.
1. For every (k,l)∈I×J,
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl∈ {bk, akl}.
2. For every k∈Iand for every l /∈ {j1,j2,...,j h},
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=akl.
These properties extend those of the matrices A(i,j)given in (25a), (25b) and (26). They ensure that the modiﬁcat ions
introduced by A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)affect only the columns indexed by j1,j2,...,j h, while all other coefﬁcients of the matrix A
remain unchanged.
Proof. Let
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m.
By induction on h, we easily obtain the following two results:
- From (25a) , (25b) and (27), we deduce:
∀(k,l)∈I×J, a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl∈ {bk, akl}. (66)
- From (25b) and (27), we deduce:
∀k∈I,∀l /∈ {j1,j2,...,j h}, a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=akl. (67)
Proposition 2. Let⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)∈Ihbe anh-tuple of two-by-two distinct indices of the set Iand⊳vectorj=
(j1,j2,...,j h)∈Jh. For any permutation πof the set {1,2,...,h}i.e.,π:{1,2,...,h} → {1,2,...,h}:λ/mapsto→iλ,
deﬁne
⊳vectori⊳π=/parenleftbig
iπ(1),iπ(2),...,iπ(h)/parenrightbig
and⊳vectorj ⊳π=/parenleftbig
jπ(1),jπ(2),...,j π(h)/parenrightbig
. (28)
Then, the matrix obtained by successively modifying Ausing the pairs (i1,j1),(i2,j2),...,(ih,jh)is identical to the
matrix obtained by applying these modiﬁcations in any permu ted order; that is,
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A(⊳vectori⊳π,⊳vectorj⊳π), (29)
or equivalently,
A(i1,j1)∗(i2,j2)∗···∗(ih,jh)=A(iπ(1),jπ(1))∗(iπ(2),jπ(2))∗···∗(iπ(h),jπ(h)).
Proof. The proof of (29) is based on the case h= 2established in Lemma 5 and on the following two results:

• Let⊳vectori= (i1,...,ih)∈Ihbe a tuple of pairwise distinct indices and ⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h)∈Jh. For any pair of
permutations (π,π′)of the set {1,2,...,h}, we have
⊳vectori⊳(π◦π′) = (⊳vectori⊳π)⊳π′,⊳vectorj ⊳(π◦π′) = (⊳vectorj ⊳π)⊳π′. (68)
Indeed, set⊳vectori′:=⊳vectori⊳π= (i′
1,...,i′

λ=iπ(λ). It follows that
(⊳vectori⊳π)⊳π′=⊳vectori′⊳π′= (i′
π′(1),i′
π′(2),...,i′
π′(h)) = (iπ(π′(1)),iπ(π′(2)),...,iπ(π′(h))) =⊳vectori⊳(π◦π′).
The proof of the equality ⊳vectorj ⊳(π◦π′) = (⊳vectorj ⊳π)⊳π′is identical to that of ⊳vectori⊳(π◦π′) = (⊳vectori⊳π)⊳π′.
• Letπ,π′be two permutations of the set {1,2,...,h}. Suppose that for every ⊳vectori= (i1,...,ih)∈Ih(with
pairwise distinct indices) and every ⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h)∈Jh, we have the equality (29) for πandπ′:
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A(⊳vectori⊳π,⊳vectorj⊳π)andA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A(⊳vectori⊳π′,⊳vectorj⊳π′).
Then, for every ⊳vectori= (i1,...,ih)∈Ih(with pairwise distinct indices) and every ⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h)∈Jh, we
have
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A(⊳vectori⊳(π◦π′),⊳vectorj⊳(π◦π′)).
Indeed, set⊳vectori′=⊳vectori⊳π and⊳vectorj′=⊳vectorj ⊳π . By hypothesis, we have
A(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)=A(⊳vectori′⊳π′,⊳vectorj′⊳π′).
Then, by (68),
A(⊳vectori⊳(π◦π′),⊳vectorj⊳(π◦π′))=A(⊳vectori′⊳π′,⊳vectorj′⊳π′)=A(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)=A(⊳vectori⊳π,⊳vectorj⊳π)=A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj).
By a classical result in permutation group theory, every per mutation πof the set {1,2,...,h}is a composition of
transpositions of the form τ= (λ,λ+1) with1≤λ≤h−1(see [28]).
For each1≤λ≤h−1, the transposition τ= (λ,λ+1) is the permutation of the set {1,2,...,h}deﬁned for every
λ′∈ {1,2,...,h}by
τλ′=

λ′ifλ′/∈ {λ,λ+1}
λ+1 ifλ′=λ
λ ifλ′=λ+1.
We have shown that in order to obtain (29) for every permutati onπ, it sufﬁces to establish it for every transposition
τ= (λ,λ+1) with1≤λ≤h−1.

Then we have, see (27) and (28) :

E(iλ+2,jλ+2)∗···∗(ih,jh),ifλ+1< h.
By applying Lemma 5 to the matrix C, we obtain the equality D=E, which implies that
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A(⊳vectori⊳τ,⊳vectorj⊳τ).
Proposition 3. LetA= [akl]∈[0,1]n×m,⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)∈Ihbe anh-tuple of two-by-two distinct indices and
⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h)∈Jh. We construct the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤musing (27). We have:
1. For all (k,l)∈I×J, we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl∈ {bk,akl}.
2. For all λ∈ {1,...,h}, we have δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(iλ,jλ) = 0 .

3. For all s∈Iand for all l∈ {j1,j2,...,j h}, we have δA(s,l) = 0 =⇒δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l) = 0 .
4. For all s∈Iand for all l /∈ {j1,j2,...,j h}, we have δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l) =δA(s,l).
Proof. To prove the four statements, we use that for every λ∈ {1,2,...,h}, we have
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj):=A(i1,j1)∗(i2,j2)∗···∗(ih,jh)=C(iλ,jλ), C:=A(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′), (69)
with the(h−1)-tuples
⊳vectori′:= (i1,...,/hatwideiλ,...,ih)and⊳vectorj′:= (j1,...,/hatwidejλ,...,j h)
obtained from the h-tuples
⊳vectori= (i1,...,iλ,...,ih)and⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j λ,...,j h)
by removing the λ-th component (see Proposition 2).
1. Forh= 1, we have A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A(i1,j1), and the result follows from (26).
Forh >1, set
C:=A(i1,j1)∗(i2,j2)∗···∗(ih−1,jh−1)= [ckl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m.
By deﬁnition, A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=C(ih,jh)and by the induction hypothesis, for all (k,l)∈I×J, we have ckl∈
{bk,akl}. Using (26), we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl∈ {bk,ckl}. Then, it follows that for every (k,l)∈I×J,
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl∈ {bk,akl}.
2. Letλ∈ {1,2,...,h}. SetA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=C(iλ,jλ)(see (69)). Then, by statement 2 of Lemma 3, we deduce that
0 =δC(iλ,jλ)(iλ,jλ) =δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(iλ,jλ).
3. Forh= 1, we have A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A(i1,j1)andl=j1. By statement 2 of Lemma 3, we deduce that
δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l) =δA(i1,j1)(s,j1) = 0.
Forh >1, we distinguish the following two cases:
• Suppose that {j1,j2,...,j h}={l}. In this case,
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj):=A(i1,l)∗(i2,l)∗···∗(ih,l)=C(ih,l)withC:=A(i1,l)∗···∗(ih−1,l).
By the induction hypothesis applied to the matrix C=A(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)obtained (see (27)) by (h−1)com-
positions deﬁned by⊳vectori′:= (i1,...,ih−1)and⊳vectorj′:= (l,l,...,l), we have δC(s,l) = 0 . By applying
statement 2 of Lemma 3, we conclude that
δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l) =δC(ih,l)(s,l) = 0.
• Suppose that {j1,j2,...,j h}\{l} /\e}atio\slash=∅. Using (29), we may assume that there exists 1≤h′< h such
that
∀λ∈ {1,...,h′}, jλ=landl /∈ {jh′+1,...,j h}.
By the induction hypothesis applied to the matrix
C:=A(i1,l)∗(i2,l)∗···∗(ih′,l)
obtained in (27) by h′< h compositions deﬁned by (i1,...,ih′)and(l,l,...,l), we have δC(s,l) = 0 .
From (27), we deduce that
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=C(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′),
with
⊳vectori′:= (ih′+1,...,ih)and⊳vectorj′:= (jh′+1,...,j h).
Sincel /∈ {jh′+1,...,j h}, the matrices CandC(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)=A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)have the same l-th column, see the
second statement of Proposition 1. Hence, by (8) we get:
δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l) =δC(s,l) = 0.
31
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
4. We observe that the matrices A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)andAhave the same l-th column, see Proposition 1. Hence,
δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l) =δA(s,l).
Proposition 4. LetA= [akl]∈[0,1]n×m, Let⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)∈Ihbe anh-tuple of two-by-two distinct indices
of the set Iand⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h)∈Jh. We construct the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]using (27). For any matrix
T∈[0,1]n×mverifying δT(iλ,jλ) = 0 for allλ∈ {1,2,...,h}, we have:
∀(k,l)∈I×J,|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl−akl|≤|tkl−akl|. (30)
It clearly follows that:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblpforp∈ {1,2,∞}.
Proof. We proceed by induction on h. Lemma 4 establishes the case h= 1.
Suppose that h >1. Let
C:=A(i1,j1)∗(i2,j2)∗···∗(ih−1,jh−1)= [ckl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m.
We have
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=C(ih,jh),
(see (27)). Since δT(iλ,jλ) = 0 for allλ∈ {1,2,...,h−1}, by the induction hypothesis we have
∀(k,l)∈I×J,|ckl−akl| ≤ |tkl−akl|. (70)
It follows from (70) that, in order to establish (30), it sufﬁ ces to consider the cases where
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl/\e}atio\slash=ckl.
But, by applying (25a) and (25b) to the matrix Cand using the equality A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=C(ih,jh), we obtain
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
ihjh=/braceleftBigg

Furthermore,
∀k∈I,∀l∈J\{jh}, a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=ckl. (72)
This implies that
{(k,l)∈I×J|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl/\e}atio\slash=ckl} ⊆/parenleftbig

It remains to show that/vextendsingle/vextendsinglea(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)

in the case where l=jh,k∈ {ih}∪UC

kjh/\e}atio\slash=ckjh.
Step 1. Suppose that k=ihanda(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
ihjh/\e}atio\slash=cihjh. Then, from (71) we deduce that
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
ihjh=bihandbih> cihjh.
By applying the ﬁrst statement of Proposition 3 to the matrix C, we obtain cihjh=aihjh. ButδT(ih,jh) = 0 implies
bih≤tihjh, see (8), hence
aihjh=cihjh< bih=a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
ihjh≤tihjh,
which implies/vextendsingle/vextendsinglea(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
ihjh−aihjh/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤ |tihjh−aihjh|.
Step 2. Suppose that k∈UC
ihjh. That is,
σG(bih,ckjh,bk) = min/parenleftBig(bih−bk)+
2,(ckjh−bk)+/parenrightBig
>0.
Then, we have, successively:
32
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
•bih> bkandckjh> bk. Since by the ﬁrst statement of Proposition 3, we have ckjh∈ {bk,akjh}, we deduce
thatckjh=akjh.
• The hypothesis δT(ih,jh) = 0 implies
σG(bih,tkjh,bk) = min/parenleftBig(bih−bk)+
2,(tkjh−bk)+/parenrightBig
= 0.
Sincebih> bk, it follows that tkjh≤bk.
• From (71), we deduce that a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kjh=bk.
Finally, we obtain:
tkjh≤bk=a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kjh< ckjh=akjh,
which implies/vextendsingle/vextendsinglea(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kjh−akjh/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤ |tkjh−akjh|.
This completes the proof.
Proposition 5. Let(⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih),⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h))be a pair of h-tuples as in Deﬁnition 6.
Then, the coefﬁcients of the modiﬁed matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m, see (27), are given by:
for every (k,l)∈I×J, a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=/braceleftBigg
bk,if(k,l)∈ E,
akl,if(k,l)/∈ E.
Proof. For every (k,l)∈I×J, set
/tildewideakl=/braceleftBigg
bkif(k,l)∈ E,
aklif(k,l)/∈ E.(73)
To prove that a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=/tildewideaklfor every (k,l)∈I×J, we proceed by induction on h.
Before performing our induction, note that for every (k,l)∈I×Jsuch that l /∈ {j1,j2,...jh}, we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=
akl=/tildewideakl: this result is deduced from the second statement of Proposi tion 1 and the fact that (k,l)/∈ E.
•Ifh= 1, then we have:
E1=/braceleftBigg
{(i1,j1)}ifbi1> ai1j1,
∅ ifbi1≤ai1j1,E2=UA
i1j1×{j1}andE=E1∪E2,see (31).
As we have A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A(i1,j1), then by using (73), (25a) and (25b), one can easily check tha t for every k∈I, we have
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kj1=/tildewideakj1.
•Suppose that for all pairs (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)of(h−1)tuples as in Deﬁnition 6, we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=/tildewideaklfor every (k,l)∈I×J.
Let(⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih),⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h))be a pair of h-tuples as in Deﬁnition 6 and E1,E2, andEbe the sets
associated to the pair (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)as in (31). We will use that for every λ∈ {1,2,...,h}, we have, see (27) and (29):
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=C(iλ,jλ)whereC=A(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)(74)
and(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)is the pair obtained by removing the λ-th component from (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)whose corresponding sets E′
1,E′
2, andE′
are deﬁned in (32).
Let(k,l)be a pair in I×{j1,...,j h}and let us prove that a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=/tildewideakl:
• If(k,l)∈ E1, there is an index λ∈ {1,...,h}such that:
(k,l) = (iλ,jλ), biλ> aiλjλand/tildewideakl=biλ,see (31) and (73).
33
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
By setting A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=C(iλ,jλ)withC=A(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)as in (74), we get from (25a):
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=/braceleftBigg
biλ ifbiλ> ciλjλ,
ciλjλifbiλ≤ciλjλwhereC= [ck′l′]1≤k′≤n,1≤l′≤m.
If the inequality biλ≤ciλjλholds , then we get aiλjλ< biλ≤ciλjλ. As from the ﬁrst statement of
Proposition 1, we have ciλjλ∈ {biλ,aiλjλ}, we conclude that in this case biλ=ciλjλ=a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
klso in both
cases, we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl=biλ=/tildewideakl.
• If(k,l)∈ E2, there is an index λ∈ {1,...,h}such that:
l=jλ, k∈UA
iλjλand/tildewideakl=bk,see (31) and (73).
Ask/\e}atio\slash=iλ, see (6) and (22), by setting A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=C(iλ,jλ)withC=A(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)as in (74), we get from (25b):

iλjλ, we deduce ckjλ≤bk< akjλ.
As from the ﬁrst statement of Proposition 1, we have ckjλ∈ {bk,akjλ}, we conclude that in this case
bk=ckjλ=a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kjλso in both cases, we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kjλ=bk=/tildewideakjλ.
• If(k,l)/∈ E, we know from (73) that /tildewideakl=akl. As we suppose that l∈ {j1,j2,...,j h}, there is an index
λ∈ {1,...,h}such that l=jλ. Let us write A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=C(iλ,jλ)withC=A(⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′)as in (74), then from
Lemma 6, we get that (k,l) = (k,jλ)/∈ E′, so by applying the induction hypothesis to the pair (⊳vectori′,⊳vectorj′), we
obtain that ckjλ=akjλ.
In both cases k=iλork/\e}atio\slash=iλ, we claim that a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kjλ=ckjλ=akjλ:
–ifk=iλ, then(k,jλ)/∈ E implies that biλ≤aiλjλ. As we have ciλjλ=aiλjλ, sobiλ≤ciλjλ, then
from (25a) applied to the matrix Cand the pair (iλ,jλ), we get:
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
iλjλ=ciλjλ=aiλjλ.
–ifk/\e}atio\slash=iλ, then(k,jλ)/∈ E implies that k /∈UA
iλjλ, see (31). From the equality ckjλ=akjλ, we get
from (22) that k /∈UC
iλjλand from (25b) applied to the matrix Cand the pair (iλ,jλ), we get:
a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kjλ=ckjλ=akjλ.
Corollary 2. Let(⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih),⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h))be a pair of h-tuples as in Deﬁnition 6.
Then, we have:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞= max
1≤λ≤h/ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞ (33)
Proof. By the second statement of Proposition 3, for every λ∈ {1,...,h}, we have δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(iλ,jλ) = 0 . Using the
second statement of Lemma 4 with T:=A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), we deduce the inequality /ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞for
everyλ∈ {1,...,h}.
We have proven the inequality maxλ∈{1,...,h}/ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞.
As (33) is clear if A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)=A, we suppose that /ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞>0.
Let us ﬁx (k,v)∈I×Jsuch that 0</ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞=|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)

From the second statement of Proposition 1, we deduce that v∈ {j1,j2,...,j h}. Fix/tildewideλ∈ {1,2,...,h}such that

kj/tildewideλ−akj/tildewideλ|. (75)
Using Proposition 5 with the set Eassociated with (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), we assert that (k,j/tildewideλ)∈ E. AsE=E1∪E2, we distinguish
the following two cases:
• if(k,j/tildewideλ)∈ E1, then we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kj/tildewideλ=bk. Moreover, there exists some λ∈ {1,2,...,h}such that

We have established (33).
A.4 Proof of the results in Section 4
Theorem 1. We use the non-empty set Nincwithh:= card(Ninc), see (24). Choose an arbitrary enumeration of Ninc
as{i1,i2,...,ih}and set⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih). Then, for every h-tuple⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)∈Jh, the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
constructed with (27) yields a consistent system, which is:
(S(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)) :A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/squaremax
minx=b.
Therefore, the matrix A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)belongs to the set Tsee (17).
Forp∈ {1,2,∞}, we have:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp≥˚∆p,
see (18) for the deﬁnition of ˚∆p.
Proof. We must show that for every s∈I, we have, see (7), (11), (12):
δA(/vectori,/vectorj)
s= 0.
We have the partition, see (24):
I=Ninc∪Ncons,
with
Ninc={i1,...,ih}and⊳vectori:= (i1,...,ih).
• Ifs∈Ninc, then there exists a unique λ∈ {1,2,...,h}such that s=iλ. By statement 2 of Proposition 3, it
follows that
δA(/vectori,/vectorj)
s≤δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,jλ) =δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(iλ,jλ) = 0.
35
Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relationa l equations A P REPRINT
• Ifs∈Ncons, thenδA
s= 0. Letl∈Jbe such that δA(s,l) = 0 . Then, by statements 3 and 4 of Proposition 3,
we deduce that
δA(/vectori,/vectorj)
s≤δA(/vectori,/vectorj)(s,l) =δA(s,l) = 0.
Theorem 2. Retain the notations from Theorem 1 and let
A= [akl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤mand⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih)such that Ninc={i1,i2,...,ih}
Then, for every consistent system whose right-hand side vec tor isb:
T/squaremax
minx=b,withT= [tkl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m∈ T,
there exists an h-tuple⊳vectorj= (j1,j2,...,j h)∈Jhsuch that the system
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/squaremax
minx=b
is consistent and, for every (k,l)∈I×J,
|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl−akl| ≤ |tkl−akl|whereA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]1≤k≤n,1≤l≤m.
We have:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp forp∈ {1,2,∞}.
Proof. It is an immediate consequence of Proposition 4 and Theorem 1 .
We use the partition
I=Ninc∪Ncons,
with
Ninc={i1,...,ih}and⊳vectori:= (i1,...,ih).
For every λ∈ {1,2,...,h}, sinceδT
iλ= 0, we choose jλ∈Jsuch that
δT(iλ,jλ) = 0,
and form the h-tuple(j1,...,j h), see (7), (11), (12).
By Theorem 1, we know that the system
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)/squaremax
minx=b
is consistent.
By Proposition 4, we have
∀(k,l)∈I×J,/vextendsingle/vextendsinglea(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl−akl/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤/vextendsingle/vextendsingletkl−akl/vextendsingle/vextendsingle.
Corollary 3. Recall that for p∈ {1,2,∞}we deﬁned in (18):
˚∆p:= inf
T∈T/ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp.
Then, it follows from Theorems 1 and 2 that
˚∆p= min
⊳vectorj∈Jh/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp. (34)
Moreover, this minimum is independent of the particular enu meration {i1,i2,...,ih}of the set Nincchosen to deﬁne
theh-tuple⊳vectori= (i1,i2,...,ih).
Proof. Letp∈ {1,2,∞}. Deﬁne
∆′= min

• By Theorem 1, for every ⊳vectorj∈Jhwe have
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈ T,
so that
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp≥˚∆p.
Hence,∆′≥˚∆p.
• By Theorem 2, for every matrix T∈ T there exists an h-tuple⊳vectorj∈Jhsuch that the matrix
A(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)= [a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl]
satisﬁes
∀(k,l)∈I×J,/vextendsingle/vextendsinglea(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kl−akl/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤/vextendsingle/vextendsingletkl−akl/vextendsingle/vextendsingle.
For each of the three norms considered, it then follows that
∆′≤ /ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dblp≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp,
and therefore,
∆′≤min
T∈T/ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dblp=˚∆p.
Thus, we deduce that ∆′=˚∆p.
Theorem 3. Let(S) =A/squaremax
minx=bbe an inconsistent system. Then, for any (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈LA,∞(see (37)), we have:
1.˚∆∞=/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞.
2.˚∆∞= max 1≤λ≤h/ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞where⊳vectori= (i1,...,ih)and⊳vectorj= (j1,...,j h).
Proof. First, we note that the second statement can be deduced from t he ﬁrst one and Corollary 2.
By the deﬁnition (37) of the set LA,∞, Theorem 1 and the inconsistency of the system (S), we deduce that we have:
0<˚∆∞≤ /ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞.
To prove the ﬁrst statement, one must check that for any matri xT∈ T, i.e., the system T/squaremax
minx=bis consistent, we
have/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dbl∞.
LetTbe any matrix in the set T. By the consistency of the system T/squaremax
minx=b, we have:
∀i∈I∃l∈Jsuch that δT(i,l) = 0,
see (7), (11)and (12).
For each λ∈ {1,2,...,h}, we choose an index lλ∈Jsuch that δT(iλ,lλ) = 0 and construct (Deﬁnition 5) the
matrixA(iλ,lλ)= [a(iλ,lλ)
kv]which, by Lemma 4, satisﬁes:
∀(k,v)∈I×J ,|a(iλ,lλ)
kv−akv|≤ /ba∇dblA(iλ,lλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dbl∞ (76)
As(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈LA,∞we deduce from the deﬁnition (37) of the set LA,∞and (76):
∀λ∈ {1,2,...,h},∀(k,v)∈I×J,|a(iλ,jλ)
kv−akv|≤ /ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblA(iλ,lλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dbl∞.(77)
Let us ﬁx (k,v)∈I×Jsuch that 0</ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞=|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kv−akv|.
From the second statement of Proposition 1, we deduce that v∈ {j1,j2,...,j h}. Fix/tildewideλ∈ {1,2,...,h}such that
v=j/tildewideλand note that with this additional notation, we have:
0</ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞=|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kj/tildewideλ−akj/tildewideλ|. (78)
Using Proposition 5 with the set Eassociated with (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj), we assert that (k,j/tildewideλ)∈ E. AsE=E1∪E2, we distinguish
the following two cases:

• If(k,j/tildewideλ)∈ E1, then we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kj/tildewideλ=bk. Moreover, there exists some λ∈ {1,2,...,h}such that
k=iλ, j/tildewideλ=jλ,andbiλ> aiλjλ.
Then, we have:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞=|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kj/tildewideλ−akj/tildewideλ|=|biλ−aiλjλ|=|a(iλ,jλ)
iλjλ−aiλjλ|,see (25a)
≤ /ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblA(iλ,lλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dbl∞,see (77).
• If(k,j/tildewideλ)∈ E2, then we have a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kj/tildewideλ=bk. Moreover, there exists some λ∈ {1,2,...,h}such that:
k∈UA
iλjλandj/tildewideλ=jλ.
Then, we have:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞=|a(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)
kj/tildewideλ−akj/tildewideλ|=|bk−akjλ|=|a(iλ,jλ)
kjλ−akjλ|,see (25a)
≤ /ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblA(iλ,lλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dbl∞,see (77).
Corollary 4. For any system (S) :A/squaremax
minx=b, we have:
˚∆∞= max
i∈Imin
j∈Jmax/bracketleftBig
(bi−aij)+,max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i/parenleftBig
θ(i,k)·(akj−bk)+/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig
(38)
whereθ:I×I/mapsto→ {0,1}:θ(i,k) =/braceleftbigg1ifbi> bk
0otherwiseand was deﬁned in (23).
The formula (38) can be reformulated using the set Ninc, see (24):
˚∆∞= max
i∈Nincmin
j∈Jmax/bracketleftBig
(bi−aij)+,max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i/parenleftBig
θ(i,k)·(akj−bk)+/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig
.
Proof. We distinguish the following two cases:
• Suppose that the system (S)is consistent. As in this case ˚∆∞= min T∈T/ba∇dblT−A/ba∇dbl∞= 0, we must prove
that for all i∈Iwe have:
min
j∈Jmax/bracketleftBig
(bi−aij)+,max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i/parenleftBig
θ(i,k)·(akj−bk)+/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig
= 0.
By (11) and (12), we know that for all i∈I, we have:
δA
i:= min
j∈JδA(i,j) := min
j∈Jmax[(bi−aij)+,max
k∈IσG(bi,akj,bk)] = 0,
see (7) and (8).
AsσG(x,y,z) = min((x−z)+
2,(y−z)+)for allx,y,z in[0,1], the following implication is true:
δA
i= 0 =⇒min
j∈Jmax[(bi−aij)+,max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i(θ(i,k)·(akj−bk)+)] = 0. (79)
We haven proven (38) in the consistent case.
• Suppose that the system (S)is inconsistent. We take a pair (⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)∈LA,∞so by the ﬁrst statement of Theorem
3, we have
˚∆∞=/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞.
As⊳vectori= (i1,...,ih)where{i1,...,ih}is an enumeration of the set Ninc={i∈I|δA
i>0}, we deduce
from Corollary 2, the deﬁnition (37) of the set LA,∞and the fourth statement of Lemma 3 that we have:
/ba∇dblA(⊳vectori,⊳vectorj)−A/ba∇dbl∞= max
1≤λ≤h/ba∇dblA(iλ,jλ)−A/ba∇dbl∞
= max
1≤λ≤hmin
j∈J/ba∇dblA(iλ,j)−A/ba∇dbl∞
= max
1≤λ≤hmin
j∈Jmax[(biλ−aiλj)+,max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=iλ(θ(iλ,k)·(akj−bk)+)].

We conclude that the equality ˚∆∞= max i∈Iminj∈Jmax/bracketleftBig
(bi−aij)+,maxk∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i/parenleftBig
θ(i,k)·(akj−bk)+/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig
is equivalent to:
max
i∈Nincmin
j∈Jmax[(bi−aij)+,max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i(θ(i,k)·(akj−bk)+)] = 0 withmax
∅= 0.
But, asNinc={i∈I|δA
i= 0}, by using (79) for all i∈Ninc, we get:
min
j∈Jmax[(bi−aij)+,max
k∈I,k/ne}ationslash=i(θ(i,k)·(akj−bk)+)] = 0.
We haven proven (38) in the inconsistent case.
