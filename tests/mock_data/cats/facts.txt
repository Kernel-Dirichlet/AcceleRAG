Cats have been domesticated for over 4,000 years, originally valued for their ability to control pests.

The average cat sleeps 12-16 hours per day, conserving energy for hunting activities.

Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees and move them independently to pinpoint sounds.

A cat's nose print is unique, much like a human's fingerprint.

Cats have a special reflective layer behind their retinas called the tapetum lucidum, enhancing night vision.

Cats can jump up to six times their body length in a single bound.

The world's oldest cat lived to be 38 years old.

Cats have 230 bones in their body, while humans have 206.

Cats can make over 100 different sounds, while dogs can only make about 10.

Cats walk on their toes, which is why they move so quietly and gracefully.
