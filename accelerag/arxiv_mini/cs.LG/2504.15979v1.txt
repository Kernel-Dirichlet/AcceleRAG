Abstract
Understanding the dynamic transition of motifs in temporal graphs
is essential for revealing how graph structures evolve over time,
identifying critical patterns, and predicting future behaviors, yet
existing methods often focus on predefined motifs, limiting their
ability to comprehensively capture transitions and interrelation-
ships. We propose a parallel motif transition process discovery
algorithm, PTMT, a novel parallel method for discovering motif
transition processes in large-scale temporal graphs. PTMT inte-
grates a tree-based framework with the temporal zone partition-
ing (TZP) strategy, which partitions temporal graphs by time and
structure while preserving lossless motif transitions and enabling
massive parallelism. PTMT comprises three phases: growth zone
parallel expansion, overlap-aware result aggregation, and deter-
ministic encoding of motif transitions, ensuring accurate tracking
of dynamic transitions and interactions. Results on 10 real-world
datasets demonstrate that PTMT achieves speedups ranging from
12.0×to 50.3×compared to the SOTA method.

https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXXdetection and analysis of motifs have broad applications across
various fields. For instance, in social networks, motifs help iden-
tify interaction patterns among users [ 42]; in biological networks,
motifs assist in uncovering functional relationships between genes
or proteins [ 13]; in cybersecurity, motifs can be used to detect po-
tential anomalous behaviors [ 12]. These applications highlight the
importance of motif detection in understanding the dynamics of
complex systems and revealing underlying patterns.
In temporal graphs, where edges and nodes change over time,
motifs evolve from static structures to dynamic subgraph patterns,
reflecting the shifting nature of relationships within a network [ 44].
While early studies primarily focused on static graphs [ 42], recent
research underscores the importance of tracking motif evolution
to capture temporal dependencies [ 24]. Understanding how motifs
transform over time not only provides critical insights into graph
dynamics but also helps in modeling real-world phenomena such
as social interactions, disease transmission, and changes in collabo-
rative networks [ 15,35]. By examining motif evolution, researchers
can identify emerging patterns and predict future structural changes
within a graph.
By quantifying motif transition (or evolution) over time, re-
searchers can gain a clearer understanding of how graph structures
dynamically change, bridging the gap between static analysis and
evolving network behaviors. However, current methodologies for
motif transition analysis face several key challenges, particularly
when applied to large-scale temporal graphs. First, these methods
typically suffer from high time complexity. As the graph size and
the number of time steps increase, the combinatorial complexity of
motif transition increases rapidly, leading to a sharp rise in compu-
tational demands and a noticeable drop in algorithm performance
[16]. This makes them difficult to use for real-time or near-real-time
analysis in large-scale temporal graphs. Second , memory consump-
tion is another significant issue, especially when large amounts of
temporal data and motif transition trajectories need to be stored,
severely limiting the scalability of these methods [ 33].Third , many
existing methods involve redundant computations and inefficient
steps, particularly during the dynamic tracking of motif transition,
lacking targeted optimizations [ 34]. This leads to wasted compu-
tational resources and prolonged processing times. Thus, a key
challenge in quantifying motif transition processes remains.
To address these issues, we propose a parallelized algorithm for
discovering motif transition processes. This algorithm leveragesarXiv:2504.15979v1  [cs.DB]  22 Apr 2025

massive parallelism to ensure accurate and efficient identification of
motif transitions in large-scale temporal graphs. As part of the par-
allel framework, it employs a temporal zone partitioning strategy to
divide temporal graphs into growth and boundary zones, enabling
conflict-free processing and avoiding redundant computations. Ad-
ditionally, it incorporates overlap-aware result aggregation and
deterministic encoding to optimize memory usage and computa-
tional efficiency. Results show that our algorithm achieves speedups
ranging from 12.0×to 37.3×while maintaining accurate discovery,
and it drastically reduces redundant computations. Meanwhile, our
method is highly efficient and scalable when processing large-scale
temporal graphs. Finally, we also provide a case study to show that
capturing motif evolution dynamics is meaningful and provide the
results of applying our method. The main contributions of this
paper are as follows:
•We present a parallel algorithm for the discovery of motif
transitions that guarantees precise counting while substan-
tially enhancing the efficiency of temporal graph analysis.
Our method incorporates a temporal zone partitioning strat-
egy, which facilitates the independent identification of motif
transition processes across various partitions. This approach
maximizes parallelism while maintaining accuracy.
•We address computational bottlenecks in motif transition
analysis by reducing redundant computations, lowering time
complexity, and minimizing memory overhead. Our method
efficiently handles large-scale graphs by leveraging opti-
mized parallel processing and workload distribution.
•We conduct extensive evaluations on large-scale real-world
datasets, demonstrating significant performance improve-
ments over existing approaches. Additionally, we provide an
in-depth analysis of motif transition dynamics, highlighting
how different motifs evolve in temporal graphs and identify-
ing dominant transformation patterns.
2 Related Work
Early seminal work introduced the concept of network motifs as
small recurring subgraphs that serve as the fundamental building
blocks of complex systems [ 20,41,43]. Subsequent studies further
refined static motif analysis by proposing efficient counting tech-
niques based on combinatorial principles [ 18,19,30], as well as
algorithms such as ESCAPE [ 46] and pivoting strategies for 4-node
motifs [ 27]—approaches that have been extended and improved in
later works [ 22,25,40]. In parallel, advances in statistical modeling
of networks, including mixed membership models [ 11,23] and dy-
namic stochastic blockmodels [ 54,55], have provided a probabilistic
framework that complements motif-based analyses [14].
With the advent of temporal networks, the focus has shifted
toward capturing time-dependent interactions. Formal definitions
of𝛿-temporal motifs were introduced to ensure that the events
comprising a motif occur within a specified time window [ 26,45],
while studies by Kovanen et al. [ 31,32] demonstrated that tem-
poral motifs can reveal homophily, gender-specific patterns, and
group communication dynamics [ 29,51]. Additional investigations
have extended these ideas to various domains, including financial
networks [ 37], mobile communication networks [ 36], and patent
collaboration networks [ 38], thereby underscoring the broad appli-
cability of temporal motif analysis [52, 59].In parallel to counting, a series of works have explored motif
evolution and its application in graph generation. Liu et al. [ 39] pro-
posed the Motif Transition Model (MTM) that leverages transition
probabilities for synthetic temporal graph generation, although its
counting module suffers from high computational complexity (e.g.,
𝑂(|E|3)for triangle motifs) [ 46]. Zhou et al. [ 60] introduced the
TagGen model, which discretizes continuous time into snapshots to
capture motif transitions, while other approaches have combined
mixed membership models [ 11,23] with motif statistics for dynamic
network tomography [ 53]. Additional work on independent tempo-
ral motifs for summarizing networks [ 48,49] and analytical models
for motif transitions [47, 50] has further advanced the field.
Moreover, to accelerate the counting process, Gao et al. [ 21]
developed a framework that exploits sparse matrix operations for
batch counting of heterogeneous motifs, and recent advances in
parallel and GPU-accelerated computing [ 57,58] have contributed
to efficient processing of large-scale temporal graphs. Complemen-
tary contributions by Jin et al. [ 28], Viswanath et al. [ 52], and Zeno
et al. [ 56] have examined motif dynamics in social and communi-
cation networks, thereby offering insights that span a variety of
real-world applications [17].
However, challenges remain in fully capturing the continuous
evolution of motifs and in developing scalable methods for their ef-
ficient enumeration. Therefore, our work aims to bridge this gap by
proposing a parallelized motif transition process path discovery al-
gorithm that directly models dynamic transitions and substantially
reduces computational overhead.
3 Preliminary and Problem Definition
In this section, we first introduce some preliminaries, including the
definitions of temporal graph ,𝛿-temporal motif ,motif transition , and
motif transition process . Then, we present the problem that needs
to be solved, i.e.,motif transition process discovery .
Definition 1 (Temporal Graph [ 21]).A temporal graph is a
dynamic network represented as G=(V,E,T), whereV,E, andT
denote the node set, the temporal edge set and the timestamp collection,
respectively. Each directed temporal edge 𝑒𝑡
𝑖 𝑗=(𝑣𝑖,𝑣𝑗,𝑡)records an
interaction from node 𝑣𝑖to𝑣𝑗at timestamp 𝑡∈T.
Definition 2 (𝛿-temporal Motif). A𝛿-temporal motif is de-
fined as a temporally ordered sequence of 𝑙edges that form a connected
subgraph comprising 𝑘nodes. Formally, such a 𝛿-temporal motif
is represented as 𝑀=⟨(𝑢1,𝑣1,𝑡1),(𝑢2,𝑣2,𝑡2), ...,(𝑢𝑙,𝑣𝑙,𝑡𝑙)⟩,𝑡1≤
𝑡2···≤𝑡𝑙, where𝑡𝑖−𝑡𝑖−1≤𝛿for every𝑖such that 2≤𝑖≤𝑙.

Example : Consider the interactions among nodes A, B, and C as
depicted in Figure 1. Given 𝛿=0.5hours, the following temporally

ordered sequence of edges 𝑀=⟨(𝐴,𝐵, 1:00),(𝐵,𝐶, 1:20),(𝐴,𝐶, 1:30)⟩
is valid 3-node 𝛿-temporal motif because the time interval between
any two adjacent edges is less than the given 𝛿=0.5hours, and
the static projection of this sequence forms a connected subgraph –
a triangle.
Definition 3 (Motif Transition). A motif transition 𝑇(𝑀→
𝑀′)is defined as the process by which a 𝛿-temporal motif 𝑀with𝑙
edges evolves into another 𝛿-temporal motif 𝑀′with𝑙+1edges via
the addition of a new temporal edge 𝑒new=(𝑢,𝑣,𝑡 𝑙+1), subject to the
following conditions:
•𝑡𝑙+1>𝑡𝑙, where𝑡𝑙is the timestamp of the last edge in 𝑀.
•{𝑢,𝑣}∩V(𝑀)≠∅, indicating that at least one endpoint of
𝑒newbelongs to the vertex set of 𝑀, i.e.,V(𝑀).
•There does not exist any earlier valid transition 𝑇(𝑀→𝑀′′)
prior to time 𝑡𝑙+1.
Definition 4 (Motif Transition Process [ 39]).In a given
temporal graphG, a motif transition process is defined as a sequence
of motif transitions, 𝑇(𝑀1→···→𝑀𝑙
𝑖→𝑆), w.r.t. a transition size
limit𝑙maxand a transition time limit 𝛿, where𝑆denotes the stopping
state. The process starts with a 1-edge temporal motif and ends at 𝑀𝑙
𝑖
if either of the following conditions holds:
•The motif𝑀𝑙
𝑖reaches the maximum allowed number of edges,
i.e.,𝑙=𝑙max.
•Within the time window (𝑡𝑙,𝑡𝑙+𝛿], where𝑡𝑙is the timestamp
of the last edge in 𝑀𝑙
𝑖, no new edge 𝑒𝑙+1is available to create
the next motif transition 𝑇(𝑀𝑙
𝑖→𝑀𝑙+1
𝑗).
Example: Figure 2 illustrates an edge-to-triangle motif transi-
tion process derived from Figure 1. In this example, the initial 𝛿-
temporal motif 𝑀1=⟨𝐴→𝐶⟩evolves into 𝑀2=⟨𝐴→𝐵,𝐵→𝐶⟩
and subsequently into 𝑀3=⟨𝐴→𝐵,𝐵→𝐶,𝐴→𝐶⟩, under the
constraints of 𝛿=0.5hours and𝑙max=3. This motif transition
pattern frequently appears in social network interactions where
triadic closure strengthens community bonds.

The motif transition time Δ𝑡=𝑡𝑙+1−𝑡𝑙quantifies the waiting
period between motif evolutions. Motif transition process can reveal
network dynamics, for instance, rapid triangle closures may indicate
coordinated behavior in financial networks.Problem (Motif Transition Process Discovery). Given a
temporal graphG, temporal constraint 𝛿, and transition size limit
𝑙max, motif transition process discovery is to exactly record all motif
transition processes in G.
By aggregating the transition counts of all specified temporal
motifs, we can obtain a complete statistical profile of the entire
motif transition processes. This formalism provides the foundation
for analyzing temporal network evolution patterns at scale.
4 Methodology
Our motif-transition process (MTP) discovery framework begins
with a temporal graph G, which is then partitioned into indepen-
dent zones using our zone partition strategy (Section 4.1). Then, in
Section 4.2, we adopt a parallel algorithm to assign them to differ-
ent threads. Within each zone, we extract all MTPs that satisfy the
constraints. After multi-threading, in the global merge step, we use
the “first-zone” principle for conflict resolution, ensuring that each
motif transition is uniquely and accurately counted. Finally, the
complete set of motif transitions is discovered and reported. The
workflow is shown in Figure3.

4.1 Zone Partition Strategy
On large-scale temporal graph, we adopt the data parallelism, i.e.,
partition the graph, approach to accelerate the discovery process.
However, data parallelism requires an effective temporal partition-
ing scheme that avoids over-counting motifs at partition bound-
aries. We propose the Temporal Zone Partitioning (TZP) strategy,
which divides the temporal graph into interleaved Growth Zones
andBoundary Zones . Growth Zones support independent parallel
processing, while Boundary Zones capture cross-partition motifs
and, by applying a “first-zone” rule, ensure that each motif transi-
tion is uniquely assigned to one Growth Zone. This design both
enforces strict computational boundaries and eliminates duplicate
counts.
Definition 5 (Growth Zone). Given parameters 𝜔(temporal
expansion factor), 𝛿(maximum motif duration), and 𝑙max(transition
size limit), a growth zone 𝐺𝑖is defined as a temporal segment spanning
𝐿𝑔=𝜔·𝛿·𝑙maxtime units.

Definition 6 (Boundary Zone). The boundary zone 𝐵𝑖be-
tween consecutive growth zones 𝐺𝑖and𝐺𝑖+1is an overlapping tem-
poral buffer of length 𝐿𝑏=𝛿·𝑙max. It spans:
[𝑡end(𝐺𝑖)−𝐿𝑏,𝑡end(𝐺𝑖)] (1)
The TZP strategy operates as a linear scan through the temporal
edges, creating interleaved growth and boundary zones. As illus-
trated in Figure 4, this process partitions the graph such that the
growth zones (green) can be processed independently, while the
boundary zones (orange) capture motif transition processes that
span across partitions. The choice of 𝜔balances zone independence
and computational granularity—larger values reduce inter-zone
communication but increase memory usage per partition. Through
empirical analysis, we found that 𝜔=20offers an optimal trade-off
for most real-world networks.

Lemma 4.1 (Uniqeness of motif transition attribution).
1] For any𝛿-temporal motif instance 𝑀=⟨𝑒1,...,𝑒 𝑙⟩produced by
Algorithm 1, the motif transition is confined entirely within a single
growth zone 𝐺𝑖.
Proof. By the𝛿-temporal motif definition (Def. 2), the total time
span of𝑀satisfies Δ𝑡=𝑡𝑙−𝑡1≤𝑙∗𝛿. We consider two cases:
(1)Case 1: If all edges of 𝑀reside within a single growth zone
𝐺𝑖, then clearly 𝑀⊆𝐺𝑖.
(2)Case 2: If𝑀spans multiple zones, let 𝑒𝑗be the first edge that
crosses into the adjacent growth zone 𝐺𝑖+1. By design, the
mechanism captures such edges within the boundary zone
𝐵𝑖, which is the overlapping region between 𝐺𝑖and𝐺𝑖+1.
Consequently, even if 𝑀extends into 𝐺𝑖+1, the overlapping
segment𝐵𝑖is attributed to 𝐺𝑖according to the “first-zone”
principle. Hence, 𝑀is uniquely associated with 𝐺𝑖.
□
Lemma 4.2 (Completeness of motif transition processes).
For any instance of motif transition process 𝑇=⟨𝑀1→𝑀2→
...→𝑀𝑙⟩, it guarantees that 𝑇is entirely captured by one of the
following three cases, and that the overall counting can be computed
exactly using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
|𝐺𝑖∪𝐺𝑖+1|=|𝐺𝑖|+|𝐺𝑖+1|−|𝐵𝑖|,
where𝐺𝑖and𝐺𝑖+1denote the counts from adjacent growth zones, and
𝐵𝑖is the count from their shared boundary zone.

Proof. LetΔ𝑡=𝑡𝑙−𝑡1≤𝑙∗𝛿by the definition of a 𝛿-temporal
motif transition.By Lemma 4.1 We consider three mutually exclusive
cases:
•Case 1: Motif transition entirely within a single growth
zone. If all edges of 𝑇reside within a single growth zone 𝐺𝑖,
then trivially, 𝑇⊆𝐺𝑖and is counted exactly once.
•Case 2: Motif transition extending from a growth zone
into its boundary zone. If𝑇begins in a growth zone 𝐺𝑖and
extends into the corresponding boundary zone 𝐵𝑖, then the
algorithm ensures that the motif transition is fully captured
within𝐺𝑖∪𝐵𝑖. In this case, the motif transition is counted
only once, as the extension into 𝐵𝑖does not lead to additional,
separate counts.
•Case 3: Motif transition spanning from a boundary zone
into the next growth zone. If𝑇spans from the boundary
zone𝐵𝑖into the subsequent growth zone 𝐺𝑖+1, then𝑇is
naturally counted in both 𝐵𝑖and𝐺𝑖+1. To correct for this
double counting, we apply the inclusion-exclusion princi-
ple by subtracting the overlapping count in 𝐵𝑖. That is, the
unique count for these transitions is given by
Count =|𝐺𝑖|+|𝐺𝑖+1|−|𝐵𝑖|.
Thus, by considering these three cases and applying the inclusion-
exclusion principle, the partitioning mechanism ensures that every
𝛿-temporal motif transition is uniquely and completely counted
without any omissions or duplications. □
As shown in Figure 5, the given temporal graph is partitioned into
corresponding subgraphs based on its growth zones and boundary
zones. After independently mining for motif transitions in each
subgraph, the combined result—obtained by adding the statistics
from the𝐺1subgraph to those from the 𝐺2subgraph and then
subtracting the statistics from the 𝐵1subgraph—exactly equals the
overall motif transition statistics of the original temporal graph. A
detailed analysis of the motif count reconciliation process can be
found in Appendix B.
4.2 Parallel Motif Transition Process Discovery
In Section 4.1, we divide the temporal graph into subgraphs (i.e.,
partitions) that can be counted independently and accurately. In
this section, we introduce our parallel motif transition process
discovery algorithm, namely PTMT. PTMT employs three phases to
overcome the limited parallelism and scaling challenges of previous
approaches. It enables parallel counting of motif transitions across
all subgraphs.

4.2.1 Three-Phase of Parallel Motif Transition Process Discovery.
Phase 1: Growth Zone Parallel Expansion. Each thread pro-
cesses its assigned growth zone by iterating over its temporal
edges in chronological order. For each edge 𝑒, we use a function
try_to_transit(), which takes 𝑒,𝛿,𝑙max, and the current candi-
date motif transition set B𝑘as inputs, to extract the next transition
if there exists. Specifically, it examines whether appending 𝑒to
any existing transition in B𝑘satisfies the two key constraints: The
temporal constraint, which requires that the time difference be-
tween𝑒and the last edge of the transition is at most 𝛿, and the
size constraint, which ensures that the extended transition does
not exceed𝑙maxtransitions (or edges). If both conditions are met,
the function returns the new candidate transitions generated by
appending𝑒, and these are then merged into B𝑘via the update
B𝑘←B 𝑘∪try_to_transit(𝑒,𝛿,𝑙 max,B𝑘).
Phase 2: Overlap-Aware Result Aggregation. Due to over-
lapping regions (i.e., boundary zones 𝐵𝑖), candidate motifs may be
duplicated. These duplicates are eliminated by performing local
deduplication in the boundary zones followed by an atomic global
merge. This mechanism enforces the “first-zone” principle, ensuring
each motif is counted only once.
Phase 3: Deterministic Relabeling Encoding. Candidate mo-
tifs are encoded into fixed-length strings using a deterministic rela-
beling scheme that maps original node IDs to contiguous identifiers
and concatenates them in temporal order. Specifically, for a can-
didate motif represented as ⟨(𝑢1,𝑣1,𝑡1),(𝑢2,𝑣2,𝑡2),...,(𝑢𝑛,𝑣𝑛,𝑡𝑛)⟩,
the encoding is defined asÉ𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑓(𝑢𝑖)⊕𝑓(𝑣𝑖)), where𝑓:V→N
assigns a unique numerical string to each vertex upon its first occur-
rence and⊕denotes string concatenation. This compact encoding
enables efficient 𝑂(1)hash table lookups for frequency counting,
thereby eliminating the need for costly graph isomorphism checks.
After the three phases, it produces the final output, as illustrated
in the example below. Figure 6 visualizes a motif transition tree
rooted at the 2-edge motif “0101”. Each branch corresponds to a
distinct transition path under the constraints. Specifically:
•Triangle Formation: The transition path 0101→010110
accounts for 62% of the transitions.
•Chain Extension: The transition path 0101→010102 ac-
counts for 28% of the transitions.
•Reciprocal Edge: The transition path 0101→010101 ac-
counts for 10% of the transitions.This string-coded representation provides an intuitive visualization
of the motif transition process and facilitates further analysis and
interpretation of the transition dynamics.

and node continuity condition via the function try_to_transit (𝑒,

to eliminate duplicates from overlapping boundary zones. Finally,
Phase 3 (Lines 8-9) encodes the merged motif transition processes
into fixed-length strings, and returns the resulting frequency map
M.

5.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets. We evaluate our method on 10 real-world datasets (Ta-

tions [1–10]. Further details are provided in Appendix A.3.
Baseline. We adopt the latest SOTA method TMC [ 39] as our
baseline. It accurately captures the evolution patterns of motifs
and is applicable for any given 𝛿and𝑙max. However, its inherent
global dependencies limit the native parallel efficiency. Therefore,

we augmented critical loops with basic parallel operations such as
OpenMP to fully leverage multi-threading resources and enhance
runtime performance. Note that, currently only TMC supports the
discovery of motif transition process.
Implementation. All the algorithms are implemented in C++17
and compiled under Ubuntu 22.04 with gcc 11.4.0. on GitHub. All
experiments were executed on dual-socket AMD EPYC 7402 24-
Core Processors with 256GB RAM. The default parameters are set to
𝛿=600s,𝜔=20,𝑙max=6, and 32 threads, unless stated otherwise.
5.2 Accuracy Validation
To validate the correctness of our method, we design an experiment
comparing complete-space motif counts on WikiTalk and Email-
Eu, which represent typical characteristics of medium-to-large-
scale and small-scale datasets. By setting a time window of 𝛿=
36,000seconds (10 hours) and an event sequence length of 𝜔=20,
we exhaustively traversed all transitions from 2-edge to 3-edge
temporal motifs—covering 60 distinct patterns across the six major
motif categories—on both datasets.
As shown in Figure 7, our method exactly reproduces all of
the TMC counts. On WikiTalk, it includes all 60 transformation
types—from low-frequency motifs (e.g., type 0112-4 , which ap-
pears only 49 times) to high-frequency patterns (e.g., type 0102-7 ,
which appears 113,878 times)—with an absolute count difference of
zero. For the smaller Email-Eu dataset, although the event density
distribution differs significantly (the average inter-event interval
decreases from 3.2 minutes in WikiTalk to 1.8 minutes in Email-
Eu), the outputs of both methods remain perfectly synchronized,
especially for short-term burst patterns (e.g., type 0120-6 , which
appears 72 times within 10 hours) and long-term sustained patterns
(e.g., type 0101-5 , with a cumulative count of 5,237).
5.3 Efficiency Analysis
To validate the efficiency of the algorithm, we conducted experi-
ments on 10 datasets. As shown in Table 2, our algorithm achieves
speedups ranging from 12.0 ×to 37.3×on ten datasets of varying
scales.
Notably, on StackOverflow, which contains 120 million temporal
edges, our method completes the full motif transition mining in

capability to handle ultra-large-scale data streams.
We have also observed that efficiency improvements exhibit sig-
nificant nonlinear characteristics. For medium-scale datasets (e.g.,
CollegeMsg with 50,000 edges), the 12.0 ×speedup is mainly due to
the lightweight design of the computational framework; whereas

million edges), the 35.6 ×speedup is attributed to the parallel archi-
tecture’s adaptive optimization for long-tailed event distributions.
The extreme case of Soc-bitcoin further demonstrates the scala-
bility of our method: while the baseline TMC method required
40.8 hours on average and suffered from an out-of-memory failure
probability of up to 80%, our approach—leveraging a streaming
processing mechanism—completed the computation in only 3,000
seconds while consistently keeping peak memory usage below
150GB.
This efficiency advantage, which shows a positive correlation
with data scale (Pearson coefficient 𝑟=0.91,𝑝<0.001), indicates
that our method is more suitable for the real-time analysis demands
of modern large-scale temporal networks.
Furthermore, under a 32-thread configuration, our method achieves
a strong scaling efficiency of 28.7 ×, far exceeding TMC’s 9.2 ×, in-
dicating that our parallel architecture can more fully exploit the
resources of modern multi-core processors.5.4 Thread Scalability Analysis
To assess the parallel computing capability of our approach, we
analyzed thread scalability on 9 datasets using 4 to 32 threads, with
𝛿values ranging from 60 to 6,000 seconds, as shown in Figure 8.
Notice that on large-scale graphs (e.g., Soc-bitcoin), when 𝛿is large
(greater than 600 seconds), the baseline TMC is likely to fail due to
out-of-memory. Overall, as the number of threads increases, our
method demonstrates better acceleration performance compared
to TMC.
In detail, as shown in Figure 8, on ultra-large datasets such
as WikiTalk (98k motifs), the 32-thread configuration achieves a
speedup of 28.3×(reducing runtime from 1,523 seconds to 53.8
seconds), significantly outperforming medium-scale datasets like
SMS-A, which sees a speedup of 19.7 ×. This improvement comes
from an adaptive spatiotemporal strategy that divides the motif
transition search space into smaller, multi-core compatible tasks.
For dense datasets such as Soc-bitcoin (over 100 million edges), a
32-thread configuration achieves a speedup of 35.6 ×when𝛿=60s,
whereas larger 𝛿values cause memory surges that prevent TMC
from completing. By decomposing long time windows (e.g., 6,000 s)

into sub-windows, our method achieves a scaling efficiency of 92.7%
on datasets like CollegeMsg through sub-window parallelization.
On StackOverflow, which features highly heterogeneous event
distributions, the dynamic work-stealing mechanism reduces thread
load variance from 48.7 sto 3.2 s, achieving 89.3% of theoretical
efficiency with 32 threads. Even for sparse datasets such as IA-
online-ads, parallel efficiency remains at 81.4%. Further analysis
shows that increasing the thread count from 16 to 32 on WikiTalk
achieves a marginal speedup of 1.7 ×, far surpassing the 0.3 ×ob-
served with TMC, which demonstrates the hardware adaptability
of the proposed design.
The number of motif transition types 𝑘exhibits a weak cor-
relation with thread scalability. For example, the Rec-MovieLens
dataset, despite containing only 2k motif tpyes, achieves a 32-thread
speedup of 22.1×due to dense temporal correlations (an average of
3.2 motifs per edge). This robustness enables the method to accom-
modate diverse scenarios ranging from IoT applications (low 𝑘) to
social networks (high 𝑘).
5.5 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
Figure 9 reveals the nonlinear response characteristics of our al-
gorithm with respect to the 𝛿parameter. In the Email-Eu dataset
(Fig. 9a), when 𝛿increases from 6,000 seconds to 36,000 seconds,
the traditional method’s time complexity grows as 𝑂(𝛿1.8)(from
32.4 seconds to 240 seconds), whereas our method, via a dynamic
window partitioning strategy, suppresses the complexity to 𝑂(𝛿1.1)
(from 1.3 seconds to 4.7 seconds). This advantage is derived from
two mechanisms: (1) when 𝛿>12,000seconds, the algorithm au-
tomatically subdivides the window into overlapping sub-windows
(with an overlap rate 𝜂=18%), so that the computation time forthe WikiTalk dataset (Fig. 9c) increases only by a factor of 2.1 (from
53.3 seconds to 112.6 seconds), compared to a 6.9-fold increase for
TMC (from 1,377 seconds to 9,512 seconds); and (2) a density-based
adaptive sampling strategy that filters out 72% of sparse period
events in the Rec-Movielens dataset (Fig. 9b), reducing memory
usage by 56%.
Figure 10 illustrates the impact on runtime as 𝑙maxexpands from
4 to 12. In the FaceBook dataset (Fig. 10a), the runtime of the tradi-
tional method increases cubically with 𝑙max(𝑇TMC∝𝑙2.7max), whereas
our hierarchical pruning algorithm reduces it to 𝑂(𝑙1.4max). The selec-
tion of𝜔must be dynamically adapted to both 𝛿and the temporal
span of the dataset. For historical data spanning ten years (such
as Email-Eu), it is recommended to set 𝜔∈[50,200]to balance
temporal granularity with computational cost. Notably, under the
extreme configuration of 𝛿=600𝑠and𝑙max=12, our method still
maintains stable operation via a resource reallocation mechanism,
whereas TMC suffers a failure rate of 92% due to memory overflow.
5.6 Case Study: WikiTalk Transition
The analysis of motif transition distributions with 𝛿=36000 shigh-
lights distinct patterns across motif types. For instance, the 0101
motif transitions are dominated by 010101 (34.75%) and 010102
(30.72%), while triangle closure 010121 accounts for 11.51%. Simi-
larly, 0102 predominantly evolves into 010203 (70.75%), with less
common paths such as 010232 and010230 . Aggregated over Wik-
iTalk’s 7.8 million edges, approximately 68.7% of motif transitions
result in triangle closures within one hour, 12.4% form star pat-
terns (often from administrator-user interactions), and 0.03% are
rapid "burst chains" (6+ edges in 60 seconds) linked to vandalism.
These results capture dominant patterns and rare anomalies, with

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel algorithm, PTMT,
for discovering motif transition processes in large-scale tempo-
ral graphs. Using the TZP strategy and a tree-based framework,
PTMT significantly improves computational efficiency and scalabil-
ity, achieving a speed increase of over 50 ×compared to the SOTA
method. The approach accurately captures dynamic motif evolution
through parallel processing, conflict resolution, and deterministic
encoding. Our method provides a robust foundation for applica-
tions in graph anomaly detection, graph structural prediction, and
large-scale temporal graph generation.

A.2 Complexity Analysis
For Algorithm 1, the temporal graph partitioning achieves optimal
linear scaling through single-pass edge processing. Each edge is
categorized into exactly one growth zone and at most two boundary
zones. Let𝑇be the total timespan and |E|=𝑛. Then, the number
of partitions is given by |Q|=𝑂

Totally, for Algorithm 2, let 𝑛=|E|be the total number of edges,
and assume an average event density of 𝛿. With𝑝threads, the
dominant cost lies in the expansion phase, yielding a complexity
of𝑂

B Experimental Details
We validate the correctness of our TZP strategy using the given
example in Figure 1. Given 𝛿=60minutes and 𝜔=3, the temporal
graph is divided into three zones following the TZP strategy:
•𝐺1(Growth Zone 1) : Edges within(1 : 00,10 : 00)
•𝐵1(Boundary Zone 1) : Overlap region(7 : 00,10 : 00)
•𝐺2(Growth Zone 2) : Edges within(7 : 00,16 : 00)
Table 4 summarizes the experiment results outputted from our
TZP strategy. Each row corresponds to a motif type observed in the
full graph. The columns are defined as follows: |G1|: The count of
motif transitions identified in Growth Zone 1. |G2|: The count in
Growth Zone 2.|B1|: The count in the Boundary Zone (the over-
lapping region between 𝐺1and𝐺2), which may lead to duplicate
counts.|G|: The ground truth counts in the complete graph.
The reconciled count computed using
total count =|𝐺1|+|𝐺2|−|𝐵1|,
ensuring that any duplicates from the boundary are subtracted.
Table 4: TZP vs. the ground truth ( 𝛿=3600 s,𝑙𝑚𝑎𝑥=3).
Motif Type|𝐺1| |𝐺2| |𝐵1| |𝐺1∪𝐺2| |G|
0101 1 1 0 1+1−0=2 2
0102 1 1 1 1+1−1=1 1
010232 0 1 0 0+1−0=1 1
0112 2 1 1 2+1−1=2 2
011202 1 0 0 1+0−1=1 1
011213 1 1 1 1+1−1=1 1
0121 1 1 0 1+1−0=2 2
012121 1 0 0 1+0−0=1 1
012130 0 1 0 0+1−0=1 1
Based on the results, we observed the following counts:
Efficient Discovery of Motif Transition Process for Large-Scale Temporal Graphs , ,
•For motif 0101, the combined count is 1+1−0=2, which
matches the full graph count.
•For motif 0102, the overlapping boundary causes duplicate
counting, and the reconciliation 1+1−1=1correctly adjusts
the count to the ground truth value of 1.
•Motifs with longer string representations (e.g., 010232, 011202,
011213, 012121, and 012130) are also accurately counted,
with their combined counts equaling the counts from the
full graph.
This table confirms that our TZP strategy, combined with the
conflict resolution process, accurately recovers the full dataset motif
counts without double-counting.
B.1 Thread Scalability and Parameter
Sensitivity Experiments
In our thread scalability experiments, we observed that the baseline
method incurred excessively long runtimes for larger datasets (e.g.,
Soc-bitcoin) when using 𝛿=6000 s. To accommodate datasets of
varying scales, we adjusted the parameter settings to three configu-
rations (60, 600, and 6000 seconds) corresponding to small, medium,
and large datasets, respectively.
B.2 Dataset-Specific 𝛿Configurations for
Thread Scaling Tests
Table 5 presents the 𝛿configurations used for thread scaling tests
on each dataset. For each dataset, the table specifies the value of
the temporal constraint 𝛿(in seconds) alongside the corresponding
number of motif types discovered. This information reflects the di-
versity and complexity of motif transitions across different datasets
and serves as a basis for evaluating the scalability of our method.

B.3 Case Study: Motif Transition Proportions
on WikiTalk
Table 6 provides a detailed breakdown of the motif transition pro-
portions obtained from the WikiTalk dataset using a temporal con-
straint of𝛿=36000 s. For each motif type, the table lists individual
transitions along with their counts and corresponding percentages.
For example, motif 0101 in the first row transitions to 010121 with
a count of 95,805 and a percentage of 11.51%. Furthermore, the tablepresents the overall count of evolved motifs alongside the total
number of non-evolved motifs, with the latter scaled in relation
to the evolved count. These statistics illustrate the distribution of
motif transitions and offer insights into the relative prevalence of
various motif evolution patterns, thereby emphasizing both pre-
dominant transition types and less frequently observed variations.
The implementation of our algorithm enables the effective capture
of these motif evolution dynamics.
