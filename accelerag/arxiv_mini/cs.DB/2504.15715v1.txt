Abstract —Models play a critical role in managing the vast
amounts of data and increasing complexity found in the IoT,
IIoT, and IoP domains. The Digital Shadow Reference Model,
which serves as a foundational metadata schema for linking d ata
and metadata in these environments, is an example of such a
model. Ensuring FAIRness (adherence to the FAIR Principles ) is
critical because it improves data ﬁndability, accessibili ty, interop-
erability, and reusability, facilitating efﬁcient data ma nagement
and integration across systems.
This paper presents an evaluation of the FAIRness of the
Digital Shadow Reference Model using a structured evaluati on
framework based on the FAIR Data Principles. Using the conce pt
of FAIR Implementation Proﬁles (FIPs), supplemented by a mi ni-
questionnaire, we systematically evaluate the model’s adh erence
to these principles. Our analysis identiﬁes key strengths, including
the model’s metadata schema that supports rich description s and
authentication techniques, and highlights areas for impro vement,
such as the need for globally unique identiﬁers and conseque nt
support for different Web standards. The results provide ac -
tionable insights for improving the FAIRness of the model an d
promoting better data management and reuse. This research
contributes to the ﬁeld by providing a detailed assessment o f
the Digital Shadow Reference Model and recommending next
steps to improve its FAIRness and usability.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In today’s interconnected world, effective data managemen t
is critical, especially in the areas of Internet of Things (I oT),
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and emerging Interne t
of Production (IoP) [1], [2]. These ﬁelds generate massive
amounts of data that must be efﬁciently captured, stored,
processed, and shared to realize their full potential [3]. W ithout
robust data management strategies, organizations face cha l-
lenges such as data silos, inefﬁcient operations, and limit ed
interoperability, all of which can hinder innovation and sc al-
ability. As a result, ensuring that data systems are designe d
to support effective communication and (re)usability acro ss
multiple parties is essential to succeed [4], [5].
One way to address data management challenges is through
the use of reference models [6]. Reference models serve as
standardized frameworks that provide structure and a commo n

Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy – EXC-202 3 Internet of
Production – 390621612.understanding among various stakeholders, including deve l-
opers, data providers, data consumers, and decision makers .
These models facilitate communication by providing clear
guidelines and common terminology, reducing misunderstan d-
ings, and promoting collaboration. The Digital Shadow Ref-
erence Model [7], [8] is an example of such a framework,
focusing on the representation and use of Digital Twins or
Shadows of physical assets in a structured and consistent
manner. By deﬁning key concepts, interactions, and data ﬂow s,
it supports the efﬁcient and systematic use of digital asset s.
However, ensuring the proper (re)use of data and services
within such frameworks imposes additional requirements. T he
FAIR Data Principles [9] – Findability, Accessibility, Int er-
operability and Reusability – promise to address these issu es.
These principles aim to improve the usability of data by othe rs,
whether human or machine, and provide a foundation for
efﬁcient data sharing and integration. By aligning with the se
principles, data systems become more discoverable, access ible,
and compatible, enabling greater value to be extracted from the
data. Achieving high FAIRness is critical to ensuring that the
Digital Shadow Reference Model not only serves its immediat e
purpose, but also facilitates the broader goal of making dig ital
artifacts more reusable by diverse stakeholders.
This paper aims to assess the FAIRness of the Digital
Shadow Reference Model by systematically evaluating its
alignment with the FAIR Data Principles. Through this anal-
ysis, the paper identiﬁes key beneﬁts of the model in en-
abling effective data management and highlights existing g aps
where improvements are needed. Finally, the paper provides
actionable recommendations for evolving the Digital Shado w
Reference Model to achieve greater FAIRness. These improve -
ments aim to make the model and its associated artifacts more
reusable, thereby promoting greater interoperability and utility
in IoT, IIoT, and IoP systems.

or Shadows of physical assets. While these two concepts (twi n
vs. shadow) are often used interchangeably, a key differenc e is
that Digital Twins typically include a feedback loop to the r eal
world (i.e., actuators or control mechanisms), while Digit al
Shadows do not, but instead focus more deeply on deriving
insights. Digital Shadows can serve as digital counterpart s
that reﬂect the states, behaviors, and attributes of real-w orld
entities, enabling real-time monitoring, decision making , and
analysis. By providing a standardized framework, the Digit al
Shadow Reference Model helps ensure consistency in the way
data about physical assets is collected, stored, and shared
among stakeholders. This model is particularly important i n
the IoT, IIoT, and IoP context [1], where seamless communi-
cation and interoperability across heterogeneous systems and
participants is critical.
The model deﬁnes key components and interactions that
are helpful for the creation and utilization of digital shad ows.
These include data sources (e.g., sensors), data integrati on
pipelines, and interfaces for data consumers (e.g., analyt ics
systems or other Digital Twins/Shadows). By aligning these
elements, the Digital Shadow Reference Model provides a
foundation for interoperable digital ecosystems.
B. The FAIR Principles
The FAIR Data Principles [9] - Findability, Accessibility,
Interoperability, and Reusability - were introduced to imp rove
the management and use of digital assets2. These principles
aim to ensure that data is:
1)Findable : Easily discoverable through standardized
identiﬁers and rich metadata.
2)Accessible : Available through well-deﬁned access pro-
tocols that maintain data integrity and security.
3)Interoperable : Compatible with other data and systems
via shared standards and formats.
4)Reusable : Well-described and licensed to enable broad
reuse across contexts.
Meeting these principles enhances the usability of data for
both humans and machines, and promotes seamless integratio n
and collaboration. The FAIR Principles are widely recogniz ed
as best practices in data management [10], [11] and are
increasingly being adopted across industries and dataspac es
[12]–[14].
In parallel with initiatives around FAIR Digital Objects [15]
as driver for efﬁcient data exchange3, there exist efforts to ac-
celerate broad community convergence on FAIR implementa-
tion options. One of these efforts are Reusable FAIR Implemen-
tation Proﬁles (FIP) [16], which include a mini-questionnaire
for creating an own FAIR implementation proﬁle. In this
paper, we utilize this mini-questionnaire for evaluating t he
FAIRness of the Digital Shadow Reference Model by adding
an evaluation column ranging from --to++(see Table II.
2See https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/ for a hand y overview.
3Notable drivers are the FDO Forum and the
German Federal Printing Ofﬁce.C. Why Align Reference Models with FAIR Principles?
Integrating the FAIR Principles into reference models, suc h
as the Digital Shadow Reference Model, is beneﬁcial to
addressing key challenges in modern data ecosystems. Thus
alignment ensures that the artifacts managed within the mod el
- such as data, metadata, and services - become more FAIR
and thus are more easily discoverable, accessible, and reus able.
This is especially important in typical IoT / IIoT / IoP domai ns
where large volumes of data are generated and shared among
multiple stakeholders.
Compliance with the FAIR Principles promotes interoper-
ability, enabling digital assets to function seamlessly ac ross
different systems and organizations. It also ensures that t hese
assets can be effectively reused in different contexts, max i-
mizing their value. For the Digital Shadow Reference Model,
adopting the FAIR Principles not only improves its practica l
utility, but also enhances its scalability and relevance in a data-
driven worldwide production lab.
III. M ETHODOLOGY
Evaluating the FAIRness of the Digital Shadow Reference
Model requires a structured assessment framework based on
the four pillars of the FAIR Data Principles: Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. To thi s end, the
concept of FAIR Implementation Proﬁles (FIPs) [16] provides
a robust foundation for this evaluation. The FIP framework,
supplemented by a mini-questionnaire4and a best practice
guide5, systematically breaks down each FAIR principle into
speciﬁc criteria.
This mini-questionnaire consists of 21 focused questions
designed to measure compliance with the FAIR Principles. Us -
ing this framework, we systematically assess the FAIRness o f
the Digital Shadow Reference Model, identifying its streng ths
and weaknesses through detailed responses to each criterio n.
Table I shows the complete list of FIP mini-questionnaire
questions that serve as our evaluation criteria.
Data for the assessment is gathered from descriptions of
the model, its usage within the Internet of Production project
(use case interviews), documentation, general references on the
Digital Shadow Reference Model, and literature on the FAIR
Principles and related best practices. Note that some of the se
resources are still only available internally in the said pr oject
and have not yet been published for the scientiﬁc public. The se
sources provide the necessary context and insight to assess the
alignment of the model with the FAIR Principles.
The evaluation procedure is conducted in three stages:
•Mapping the Model to FAIR Principles : The compo-
nents, processes, and outputs of the Digital Shadow Ref-
erence Model are systematically mapped to the criteria
outlined in the assessment framework.
•Scoring : Each criterion is scored based on qualitative or
quantitative metrics, such as the presence or absence of

FAIR Principles.
•Analysis : The results are synthesized to identify patterns,
including areas of strength and opportunities for improve-
ment.
While the framework provides a comprehensive approach to
assessing FAIRness, three limitations should be noted. Som e
aspects of the evaluation are inherently qualitative and ma y
involve subjective judgment. This is due to the openness of
the questions in the used questionnaire, and implies that th e
a repetition of the study might lead to slight differences in
some aspects. Such nuances however would not affect the
derived recommendations and future directions. Additiona lly,
please note that the scope of the assessment is speciﬁc to
the Digital Shadow Reference Model and may not take into
account external factors affecting its FAIRness. As the FAI R
Principles or the Digital Shadow Reference Model evolve, th e
relevance of some of the criteria may change, necessitating
periodic updates to the contributions in this paper.
IV. R ESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The results of our FAIRness evaluation of the Digital
Shadow Reference Model are summarized in Table II. The
ﬁrst table column refers to the questions from the FIP mini-
questionnaire shown in Table I. The second column gives the
answers to these questions from the perspective of the Digit al
Shadow Reference Model, and the third column indicates a
rough measure derived from these answers. Note that the last
column does not represent a quantitative metric but rather
represents a better illustration.
The areas of strength are the answers to questions #3, #4
and #10, which address the ﬁndability andaccessibility areas
of the FAIR Principles. These were evaluated with a (+)

is a metadata schema, it includes custom properties such as
data traces ordigital/physical assets for linking between data
and metadata, and it supports authentication and authoriza tion
techniques such as HTTPS, FTPS or Git credentials.
Neutral(o) scores were assigned to multiple answers,
because the Digital Shadow Reference Model’s degree of
alignment with the FAIR Principles are limited. These inclu de
the support of basic HTTP URIs as dataset identiﬁers (#2)
and a project-internal tool for indexing datasets (#6) from
theﬁndable area. From the accessible area, multiple answers
had a neutral score: The limited support for standardized
communication protocols for data and metadata (#7 and #8),
and the support for authentication and authorization techn iques
through project-internal repositories only. In the interoperabil-
ityarea, a neutral score was achieved because it supports
schemas for metadata records (#16) but only via UML and
custom cross-references. In the reusability area, two neutral
scores were achieved for supporting provenance informatio n
for both data and metadata (#20 and #21), but only with
custom ﬁelds.
The main weaknesses are as follows. No globally unique,
persistent, resolvable identiﬁers are used for metadata re cords
(#1), and metadata records are not indexed (#5) in search
engines. Longevity is only ensured by tracking some assets
with Git, but no explicit longevity plan is present (#11). Wi th
regards to interoperability , neither machine-readable knowl-
edge representation languages nor structured vocabularie s are
used for data or metadata (#12 to #15). The only available
dataset schema (#17) is a hierarchical structure based on
the project structure. A proper usage of licenses for data or
metadata assets is not covered (#18 and #19).
In summary, the results of the evaluation show varying
degrees of alignment between the Digital Shadow Reference

Model and the FAIR Principles. Strengths were identiﬁed in
the areas of ﬁndability and accessibility, with positive sc ores
reﬂecting the model’s use of custom properties for linking d ata
and metadata, and its support for authentication and autho-
rization mechanisms. However, the assessment also identiﬁ ed
several aspects with neutral scores, including basic recor d
identiﬁers, limited indexing tools, and limited support fo r
standardized protocols, schemas, and provenance informat ion.
These results suggest that while the model includes some
FAIR-aligned features, many are only partially realized or
implemented in a project-speciﬁc manner.
A more detailed analysis reveals notable gaps that hinder th e
model’s broader FAIRness. Key weaknesses include the lack
of globally unique, resolvable identiﬁers, inadequate ind exing
of metadata, and insufﬁcient planning for asset longevity.
Interoperability is constrained by the lack of machine-rea dable
languages, structured vocabularies, and robust schemas fo r
datasets, while data reusability is limited by the lack of ex plicit
licensing and alignment with domain standards. These gaps
underscore critical areas where the model could evolve to
achieve a better FAIRness.
V. R ECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
To improve the FAIRness of the Digital Shadow Reference
Model, several targeted improvements are recommended. Fir st,
the adoption of globally unique and resolvable identiﬁers,
such as Digital Object Identiﬁers (DOIs) or PIDs, would
greatly improve the ﬁndability of data and metadata. The
implementation of standardized metadata schemas, using We b
standards such as RDF or JSON-LD, could ensure broader
interoperability and better alignment with the FAIR Princi ples.
Indexing metadata in (public) search engines and registrie s
would facilitate greater accessibility. In addition, the a dop-
tion of standardized communication protocols and structur ed
vocabularies or ontologies, along with formalized licensi ng ofdata and metadata assets, would enhance both accessibility and
reusability. Together, these measures aim to bridge existi ng
gaps and support making the model more FAIR-compliant.
One step forward would be to release an updated version of
the Digital Shadow Reference Model that explicitly address es
the identiﬁed gaps. This new version should prioritize feat ures
such as globally unique identiﬁers, formalized vocabulari es,
and metadata schemas that conform to Web standards such as
RDF or JSON-LD. Collaborative workshops or focus groups
could engage stakeholders to validate these updates and ens ure
alignment with industry and academic needs. These steps mus t
continuously consider practical feasibility of any propos ed
improvement. To measure progress, periodic re-evaluation s
using the FAIR evaluation framework are essential to provid e
transparency and drive iterative improvements. Future eff orts
could also include the development of implementation guide -
lines for practitioners and case studies that demonstrate t he
impact of the improved model on real-world IoT, IIoT, and
IoP applications. These steps would not only improve FAIR
compliance, but also position the model as a benchmark for
similar frameworks.
VI. C ONCLUSION
This paper assessed the FAIRness of the Digital Shadow
Reference Model, a key framework for managing and inte-
grating data in IoT, IIoT, and IoP systems. Using a structure d
assessment based on the FAIR Data Principles and FAIR Im-
plementation Proﬁles, we identiﬁed areas of strength, such as
metadata linking and support for authentication mechanism s,
as well as signiﬁcant gaps, including the lack of globally
unique identiﬁers, limited use of standardized protocols, and
insufﬁcient metadata indexing.
To address these gaps, we proposed recommendations, in-
cluding the adoption of machine-readable metadata schemas ,

mal licensing practices. By implementing these improvemen ts
and iteratively evolving the model, the Digital Shadow Refe r-
ence Model can better align with the FAIR Principles, increa s-
ing its utility and impact across diverse digital ecosystem s.
This work lays a foundation for future efforts to integrate
the FAIR Principles into reference models to promote more
efﬁcient, collaborative, and sustainable data practices.
