You are an expert evaluator of AI responses. Your task is to evaluate the following response based on the provided context and query.

CONTEXT CHUNKS:
{context}

QUERY:
{query}

RESPONSE:
{response}

Please evaluate the response on the following criteria:

1. HALLUCINATION ANALYSIS (0-100):
- Score 1-2: Response contains major hallucinations or completely fabricated information
- Score 3-4: Response contains significant hallucinations or unsupported claims
- Score 5-6: Response has minor hallucinations or partially supported claims
- Score 7-8: Response is mostly grounded in context with few minor issues
- Score 9-10: Response is fully grounded in context with no hallucinations

2. OVERALL QUALITY (0-100):
- Score 1-2: Response is irrelevant or completely misses the query
- Score 3-4: Response is partially relevant but lacks key information
- Score 5-6: Response is relevant but could be more complete
- Score 7-8: Response is relevant and mostly complete
- Score 9-10: Response is highly relevant, complete, and well-structured

For each criterion:
1. Provide a score (1-10)
2. List specific examples from the response that support your score
3. For hallucinations, cite which parts of the response lack support in the context

Format your response as:
HALLUCINATION SCORE: [score]
Examples: [list specific examples]
Missing Context: [list unsupported claims]

QUALITY SCORE: [score]
Examples: [list specific examples]
Areas for Improvement: [list any gaps or issues]

FINAL SCORES:
- Hallucination Risk: [score]
- Overall Quality: [score]
